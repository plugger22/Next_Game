PlyrDef: 1
Data: 0
Good1: Your well prepared position have brought <men> to a temporary halt as your arrows rain down upon them.
Good2: You can see the strain on <men> as they try to clamber up and over your defences in the face of your archers.
Good3: The time spent fortifying your position has been worth it. A pile of bodies belonging to <name> lie before you.
Bad1: You decline to properly man your defences and let <men> slowly pick their way over unmolested.
Bad2: <men> carefully climb over your fortifications. Where are you archers and spear men to prevent them doing so?
Bad3: Your fortifications haven't been properly built. It was a rushed job and you're paying for it now.

Good1: <name> fortifications appear impregnable but looks are deceiving. Your Men-At-Arms are hindered but not stopped.
Good2: Did <name> think that his puny fortifications would stop you? Was there a proper engineer advising him or did he make it up himself?
Good3: <name>'s fortifications are less of an obstacle then you expected. Did <men> run out of trees to fell for a ready source of timber?
Bad1: Curse <name> and his damn fortifications! You watch as your men mill around aimlessly in front of his defences.
Bad2: <name>'s archers are having a field day picking off your men one by one as they try and climb over the fortifications.
Bad3: Where did <name> find the time and expertise to construct such wickedly effective fortifications?
