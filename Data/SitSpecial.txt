# Fortified Position ---

Name: Fortified Position
Type: Special
SubType: FortifiedPosition
PlyrDef: 1
Data: 0
Good1: Your well prepared position have brought <men> to a temporary halt as your arrows rain down upon them.
Good2: You can see the strain on <men> as they try to clamber up and over your defences in the face of your archers.
Good3: The time spent fortifying your position has been worth it. A pile of bodies belonging to <name> lie before you.
Bad1: You decline to properly man your defences and let <men> slowly pick their way over unmolested.
Bad2: <men> carefully climb over your fortifications. Where are you archers and spear men to prevent them doing so?
Bad3: Your fortifications haven't been properly built. It was a rushed job and you're paying for it now.
[End]

Name: Fortified Position
Type: Special
SubType: FortifiedPosition
PlyrDef: -1
Data: 0
Good1: <name> fortifications appear impregnable but looks are deceiving. Your Men-At-Arms are hindered but not stopped.
Good2: Did <name> think that his puny fortifications would stop you? Was there a proper engineer advising him or did he make it up himself?
Good3: <name>'s fortifications are less of an obstacle then you expected. Did <men> run out of trees to fell for a ready source of timber?
Bad1: Curse <name> and his damn fortifications! You watch as your men mill around aimlessly in front of his defences.
Bad2: <name>'s archers are having a field day picking off your men one by one as they try and climb over the fortifications.
Bad3: Where did <name> find the time and expertise to construct such wickedly effective fortifications?
[End]

# Mountain Country ---

Name: Mountain Terrain
Type: Special
SubType: MountainCountry
PlyrDef: 1
Data: 0
Good1: High ground, mountain passes and steep valley walls all work to your favour.
Good2: One man defending in the mountains is worth four down on the plains.
Good3: The mountains naturally favour the defender. You make full use of the terrain.
Bad1: <men> aren't attacking along the expected path. It's a contingency that you should have covered.
Bad2: The mountains are full of hidden paths and approaches. Have <men> found an alternative route?
Bad3: Why, if you've got the high ground, did you not place your archers where they can take advantage of it?
[End]

Name: Mountain Terrain
Type: Special
SubType: MountainCountry
PlyrDef: -1
Data: 0
Good1: <name> is basking in a false sense of security from the safety of his mountain perch. You're about to prove him wrong.
Good2: The mountains are hard. You need to know how to capitalise on their strengths. You doubt that <name> realises this.
Good3: There are few places in the mountains that don't offer alternative paths if you're prepared to risk a climb.
Bad1: <men> have wedged themselves into a tight, difficult to assault position. A costly frontal assault looks to be the only way.
Bad2: Damn <name> and damn the mountains. Why couldn't <he> fight on the plains like a proud Stag instead of a rock hoping Goat?
Bad3: Who in their right mind would want to fight in the mountains? Only a man with four legs, four arms and two *rseholes.
[End]

# Forest Country ---

Name: Forest Terrain
Type: Special
SubType: ForestCountry
PlyrDef: 1
Data: 0
Good1: Plenty of greenery and tall, climbable, trees allow your archers to pick of <men> one by one.
Good2: The density of the terrain prevent <men> from being able to launch any coordinated assault on your position.
Good3: Forest fighting is a learned skill that's hard won. You know it, <name> doesn't.
Bad1: If you'd had more time you'd have placed archers in the trees and staked the ground to funnel the attackers. If you'd had more time...
Bad2: The dense undergrowth has allowed <men> to creep unmolested a lot closer than you'd like.
Bad3: The trees and undergrowth have made it impossible for your knights to fight mounted.
[End]

Name: Forest Terrain
Type: Special
SubType: ForestCountry
PlyrDef: -1
Data: 0
Good1: Dense greenery works both ways. Your men manage to quietly move around the enemies flank, unseen.
Good2: <name> has made the mistake of leaving his knights mounted. You've got yours fighting on foot in the dense terrain.
Good3: You've posted men up the tallest trees and have managed to gain excellent situational awareness.
Bad1: Your men are spending just as much time fighting the entangling bushes as they are the enemy.
Bad2: Where are <men>? Judging by the bodies of your own men lying at your feet there are more hidden archers than trees in the forest.
Bad3: If it wasn't so damp you'd burn the whole damn forest to the ground. There is naught but death in these dank, dark, woods.
[End]

# Castle Walls

Name: Castle Walls
Type: Special
SubType: CastleWalls
PlyrDef: 1
Data: 0
Good1: One of your crossbowmen on a castle wall is worth many more of <men> milling around below.
Good2: Strong, well built, walls that are ably defended are a formidable obstacle. Your men rain death on those below.
Good3: You gaze down at <men> from the ramparts and watch as your bolt throwers and trebuchet tear holes in their ranks.
Bad1: Castle walls are only effective if there are men to defend them. You choose to ignore the walls to your rear.
Bad2: The walls are old and have not been maintained. The Castellan did warn you of this.
Bad3: You've been dismissive of <men> ability to breach the walls. Look what they are doing now...
[End]

Name: Castle Walls
Type: Special
SubType: CastleWalls
PlyrDef: -1
Data: 0
Good1: The castle has been built to look impressive. You would have built it to be practical. There's a blind spot next to the tower.
Good2: <men> have to spread thin to defend the full perimeter of the castle walls whereas you can pick and choose where to assault.
Good3: Your Trebuchets slam rocks into one part of the wall. There are already cracks and holes. A breach beckons.
Bad1: The walls are solid and appear impregnable. Each time you order your men forward they get mowed down by crossbowmen on the ramparts.
Bad2: You're losing a lot of men to the archers and crossbowmen a-high on the ramparts. All you can do is grind your teeth.
Bad3: Your ladder teams were met with boiling oil. They are refusing to give it one more try. Nobody wants their flesh sluiced off their bones.
