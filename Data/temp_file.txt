Hi Doreen,

Good to hear from you and our sad condolences regarding Francesca. 

When she visited Monica once I was around and offered to 'show her around' one morning. As I was fairly active at that time I took her for an early morning, outdoor swim followed by a brisk walk up and down the Gorge (fairly steep). It was a calm, sunny morning and a good one to be out and about. By the time I drove her to the local casino for a buffet breakfast I was worried that I might have overdone the experience. However she sat down and ate more than I did while proclaiming that it was 'lovely to be so active at the same time as the sparrows'. I remember her being very calm, polite and composed. I suspect that it took a fair bit to throw Francesca.

We visited France this year and were planning on popping over to say hello but decided against it after some discreet enquiries as we thought that you would have had enough on your plate at the time. We've marked you down for next visit, though.

Paris, the City of Romance, we thought to be rather scruffy. Cigarette butts, graffiti and rubbish everywhere. We spent four days walking around and seeing all the usual sights. After being overexposed to an abundance of artistic masterpieces I told the family that they must be all 'copies'. The real ones had to be in the basement as there is no way you that you'd leave an extremely valuable painting on the wall with next to no security. As this was a matter of contention I took the brave step of leaning forward to put the tip of my nose on a nearby Rembrandt in order to prove my point. No alarms went off and no guards came running so the matter was settled.

Until we spoke to a guard who insisted that the paintings, throughout the various main galleries in Paris, were all real. I'm still a bit dubious.

We loved the doors. Massive wooden medieval doors with great brass fittings, fit for a giant. I think we took more pictures of doors than anything else. The Parisian women were a disappointment as they all had Charles De Gaulle noses and appeared to be chain smoking themselves into oblivion but the men were beautiful. Immaculately attired with cravats, man-scarves, beards that were better trimmed than most hedges and all manner of little knicky knack accessories. In Paris I think it must be the men who hog the bathroom mirrors while the women are outside gargling industrial mouthwash and banging their heads against the walls to try and unkink their noses.

Yep, Paris - terrific doors, dirty streets, beautiful men and more artist treasures than are good for them with a special mention for the excellent metro service.

We didn't stay long and headed south where we spent the bulk of our time. Did a one week walk through the Pyrenees on the trail of old Crusader Castles. The Cathars built the castles way back when and they made the fatal mistake of refusing to pay taxes to the Pope because he wasn't pious enough. Not a good move in hindsight as he declared a crusade whereupon a bunch of French knights subsequently slaughtered and burnt most of the them (men, women, children and dogs).

The walk was 'self-guided' as in we were given maps and had places to stay each night provided we made it there by the designated time. We were met by a taxi driver at Perpignan (bottom left corner of France although you probably know more about it than we do). He drove us a couple of hours into and up a mountain. When we reached the top it was raining, clouded in and very cold. He jumped out, waved his arms in all directions with great enthusiasm pointing to all manner of things we couldn't see in the murk, heaved our bags out onto the road before jumping back into his heated taxi and roaring off, never to be seen again. The kids thought it was the most exciting thing they had seen for a while. The 'I've-got-to-get-out-of-here-right-now-taxi-driver'.
