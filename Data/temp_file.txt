Compassion (morale) - Zeal (getting the job done)
Discipline - Charisma (men follow you because of your natural leadership skills)


A sudden yell pierces the salty, night air. You lean over the railing and peer down at the landing craft. Private Roberts, your BAR gunner, is being helped to his feet after falling backwards off the boarding net. Sergeant Walters, beside you, lets loose an earthy Nebraskan curse. He points to the rear of the landing craft, bobbing up and down in the swell. There's the BAR, hanging precariously by it's strap, swinging over a dark, watery abyss. 

Yell an order down to Private Roberts to retrieve the BAR. Now, Right NOW!
It's too dangerous, your platoon will have to do without it
Ask the Captain to delay operations for a short while in order to safely retrieve the BAR

From the bowels of the landing craft you watch catch a glimpse of the Coxswain's face. He's frightened, uncertain. You can hear gunfire, screaming, the sound of splintering wood. Grimacing, the Coxswain suddenly pushes the helm hard over and swings the craft back out to sea, shying away from Red Beach.

Sounds like a good idea. Circle around for a bit and let the situation calm down.
Your men are needed on the beach! Take command of the landing craft.
This is no place for Yellow Bellies. Shoot the coxswain in the arm. Set an example.

The staccato buzz sawing of a machine gun rips up the sand beside you. The French in the nearby nest have you pinned down. Third squad is missing and Sergeant Lomax of Second squad looks more interested in being a sand mole than a warrior. It's imperative that you get your men off this exposed beach. It's a death trap.

Crawl over and attempt to Rally Second Squad. The more men the better.
Get to your feet, yell 'Follow me, Men' at First Squad and rush the nest
Have First Squad return fire while you get a better read on the situation
Call on the French gunners to Surrender. Who knows, they're French, it might work?

Hi,

Thanks for the kind words in this and other threads. 

While I won't be making another game in the series that's not to say that Vic might not find somebody else to do one in the future. Barbarossa is my take on an operational wargame but it's just as likely that somebody else's vision may well turn out to be a better one.

I'll continue supporting Barbarossa and did gain a measure of financial return from the game however the time-in-dollar-out equation is pretty dire. I have to report daily to a wife and children high command structure and while I'm willing to fight on with dwindling stocks of fuel and ammunition they've ordered me to assume command of another front. 

Vic is busy making Shadow Empires and I'm sure that it'll be just as good and successful as his previous games.

Cheers,
Cameron



Hi Doreen,

Good to hear from you and our sad condolences regarding Francesca. 
t
When she visited Monica once I was around and offered to 'show her around' one morning. As I was fairly active at that time I took her for an early morning, outdoor swim followed by a brisk walk up and down the Gorge (fairly steep). It was a calm, sunny morning and a good one to be out and about. By the time I drove her to the local casino for a buffet breakfast I was worried that I might have overdone the experience. However she sat down and ate more than I did while proclaiming that it was 'lovely to be so active at the same time as the sparrows'. I remember her being very calm, polite and composed. I suspect that it took a fair bit to throw Francesca.

We visited France this year and were planning on popping over to say hello but decided against it after some discreet enquiries as we thought that you would have had enough on your plate at the time. We've marked you down for next visit, though.

Paris, the City of Romance, we thought to be rather scruffy. Cigarette butts, graffiti and rubbish everywhere. We spent four days walking around and seeing all the usual sights. After being overexposed to an abundance of artistic masterpieces I told the family that they must be all 'copies'. The real ones had to be in the basement as there is no way you that you'd leave an extremely valuable painting on the wall with next to no security. As this was a matter of contention I took the brave step of leaning forward to put the tip of my nose on a nearby Rembrandt in order to prove my point. No alarms went off and no guards came running so the matter was settled.

Until we spoke to a guard who insisted that the paintings, throughout the various main galleries in Paris, were all real. I'm still a bit dubious.

We loved the doors. Massive wooden medieval doors with great brass fittings, fit for a giant. I think we took more pictures of doors than anything else. The Parisian women were a disappointment as they all had Charles De Gaulle noses and appeared to be chain smoking themselves into oblivion but the men were beautiful. Immaculately attired with cravats, man-scarves, beards that were better trimmed than most hedges and all manner of little knicky knack accessories. In Paris I think it must be the men who hog the bathroom mirrors while the women are outside gargling industrial mouthwash and banging their heads against the walls to try and unkink their noses.

Yep, Paris - terrific doors, dirty streets, beautiful men and more artist treasures than are good for them with a special mention for the excellent metro service.

We didn't stay long and headed south where we spent the bulk of our time. Did a one week walk through the Pyrenees on the trail of old Crusader Castles. The Cathars built the castles way back when and they made the fatal mistake of refusing to pay taxes to the Pope because he wasn't pious enough. Not a good move in hindsight as he declared a crusade whereupon a bunch of French knights subsequently slaughtered and burnt most of the them (men, women, children and dogs).

The walk was 'self-guided' as in we were given maps and had places to stay each night provided we made it there by the designated time. We were met, at the start, by a taxi driver at Perpignan Train station (bottom left corner of France although you probably know more about it than we do). He drove us a couple of hours into and up a mountain. When we reached the top it was raining, clouded in and very cold. He jumped out, waved his arms in all directions with great enthusiasm pointing to all manner of things we couldn't see in the murk, heaved our bags out onto the dirt before jumping back into his heated taxi and roaring off, never to be seen again. The kids thought it was the most exciting thing they had seen for a while. The 'I've-got-to-get-out-of-here-right-now-taxi-driver'.

The walk was great although a lot more strenuous than we were expecting. About 20 km's a day but fairly up and down and the odd difficult section. There were hot showers at the end of each day so we weren't that worried and the locals fed us very well indeed. Because it was right at the beginning of the tourist season we were the first paying customers and the locals usually sat down and had dinner with us. 

We met a woman who worked for the European Union. Her job was to go around all the farmers and help them fill in the reams paperwork in order for them to receive their annual EU subsidy. Most of the farmers she dealt with had only ten or twelve sheep to their name which we found vastly amusing as back home you'd call that a 'hobby farm' and nobody would be giving you handouts for such an unsustainable agribusiness. Her reasoning was that if the EU didn't subsidise these tiny farms then they would disappear (most likely) and nature would reclaim the ground which was a 'bad thing'. Rightly or wrongly we got the distinct impression that the EU was big on paperwork and short on common sense.

Another character was a forest 'ranger' who had the job of counting the trees, those that hadn't been chopped down to make way for Cedric the pampered sheep. He told us were were walking through bear country but not to worry as there were only a handful left (the farmers shoot them). Every time they need a replacement bear they get a new one out of the cupboard from Czechoslovakia!

We hired a car afterwards and spent a couple of weeks touring the south of France. Lovely countryside but crap drivers. They all drove as if they were Formula 1 drivers trying to get pole position at Monaco. I found the driving very stressful. Our 'luxury' Pugeot hire car was equally crap. 

We tried AirBnB for a while and had some interesting experiences. One place had been the home of a drug dealer (we think) immediately prior to us renting it and we were inundated by strung out customers looking for a hit late at night. Luckily the apartment had a triple bolted steel reinforced door which kept them at bay.

Another place in Provence looked lovely in the photos. We drove all day to get there only to find that the ceiling height was five foot ten which is a bit awkward as myself and Tristan are both well over six feet. Strangely enough the owners had only recently built it and couldn't see that there was a problem. They were very good, however, and gave us a refund and helped us find alternative accomodation more suited to 'giants'.

The French, as a whole, were very friendly, especially once they knew we were Australian. If we had spoken in a British or American accent I suspect we may have had a different experience.

We had an interesting conversation with Eloise, girlfriend of the friend we stayed with for a bit.  Her working conditions, pay and government benefits (she left her previous job and the government kept paying her the same high salary until she found a new one a year later. Even then they kept paying her money for another year to make up the difference in salary between her old job and her new one) were, from our point of view, phenomenal.

She insisted that the French pay a lot of taxes so it all evens out but it turned out they paid less than we did back home so we were scratching our heads as to how the French Government can afford the benefits they were providing. Eloise worked for a reasonable sized company manufacturing wine making equipment. They were one of three companies in that market.

Eloise said that they all had very high fixed labour costs but it didn't matter as all three companies were French and, on a relative basis, they were on par. But one of the companies had recently contracted out their production to China and were about to severely undercut the other two. I asked Eloise what steps her company were taking to counter this and she said that there wasn't much they could do given the labour laws and the unions. What would happen instead was that perhaps the parent holding company would step in and bail them out. When I asked why they would want to throw good money after bad at a loss making subsidiary she insisted that, if that was the case, then the French Government would definitely subsidise their operation as they were a long standing French company.

Mmmmm... It didn't bode well for the future of France, in our eyes. You can't hide from globalisation.

The family are all fit and well apart from myself (hobbling around with a torn hamstring muscle that's taking a while to come good). Tristan invited a Japanese exchange student to live with us for three weeks. This was another big insight into how the rest of the world lives. Mayuro, the student, was an outgoing, confident kid and he spent most of his time with us sleeping. Back home he is up at 0600, gets home from school at 8 pm, has dinner, a bath and then does homework till midnight. Even on the weekends he is still up at 0600 and off to school for a half days. Does the same on his holidays. He couldn't remember how long it was since he hadn't got up 0600 and gone of too school (hour & a half travelling time one way) for at least part of the day. That's a rat-on-a-treadmill schedule.

He could handle all the maths that our kids did at school, with fancy calculators, in his head which was very impressive and spoke way better English than we did Japanese. Interestingly while Mayuro had a black belt in how to use his mobile phone he didn't have a clue about computers. They didn't use them at school (year 10). He indicated that if you wanted to get into computers you had to attend a special school or university that dealt with them and that they were few and far between. This was a little different to our viewpoint of Japan as the ultimate hi-tech society.

Given the amount of effort we have to put in at home in order to chase our kids away from their laptops and get them off doing something physical we could see that the Japanese 'computer-free' approach had it's merits although Mayuro spent just as much time plugged into his phone as he would any other screen.

Tessa went through a period of not wanting to read books. I've been to several libraries and brought home recommended books for teenage girls, none of which she is interested in. Out of desperation one day I stood her in front of our bookcase (it's big, we are book worms) and told her to 'choose a book'.

After some consideration she asked if she could choose any of my books to which I said O.K, with reservations. I have a fairly eclectic range of interests, none of which are really appropriate for young ladies. Tessa pulled out 'The Mind of the Serial Killer' and 'The History of Cryptography'. Both books she is avidly reading and reporting back on in detail. What this says about Tessa's future trajectory in life is anyone's guess. At least she is back reading.

Tristan is going through a bit of a tough time at school at present. He's doing the International Baccalaureate which is a good thing in itself but, unexpectedly, means he is only associating with a dozen or so boys of his age as it's a niche subsection of the syllabus and separate from the mainstream. As he doesn't get along with any of them and doesn't have the social skills to fit in to a not-so-friendly group that isn't a natural fit he's been spending a fair bit of time on his own.

Once we became aware of this we organised some help for him by way of a school counsellor who is very good. He's still finding it rough going but overall the experience is probably going to toughen him up and give him a kick in the bum to develop the higher level people skills that he needs. Still, it's not easy when you're naturally a shy, reserved person and you're on the outer. Fingers crossed.

People skills are going to be in big demand once the robot overlords take over the world which will probably be fairly soon given how technology is racing ahead. I wouldn't be surprised if a third, or more, of kids going to university right now will find themselves with jobs as minimum wage makers of coffee rather than the molecular biologists that they've trained for. The Universities here are already mass producing lawyers, accountants, doctors, veterinarians and scientists in numbers way in excess of demand, let alone the qualifications further down the skill tree.

Australia is still ticking over in reasonable fashion although we are still a two product (iron ore & coal), one customer (China) economy which is a case of having your eggs all in the one basket. The country continues to be run by a conga line of dills but dills appear to be on the ascendency worldwide so this isn't anything out of the ordinary.

Best regards to yourself and family from myself and Ursula. Can't vouch for Monica but I'm sure she is having a glass of wine on your behalf.

Cheers,
Cameron
