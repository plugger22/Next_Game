Hi Budd,

[quote]Lancer so anything you can share about plans for the DC series? I remember there was going to be an announcement and then the plans changed. [/quote]

Yep, plans have changed. Vic is currently busy making  'Shadow Empires'. He'd be the best person to tell you about it but, from what I gather, it's a Scifi hex and counter game with random maps, with a likeness to one of his other games, Advanced Tactics.

The Decisive Campaigns series belongs to Vic. He made the first couple and I made Barbarossa (with his help, Vic did the AI) using his engine.

Whether Vic is eventually going to circle back around and make another Decisive Campaigns game after Shadow Empires or perhaps get somebody else to do one, as I did with Barbarossa (using Vic's engine and with Vic doing the AI), is another question best aimed at Vic.

Cheers,
Cameron

Hi Rommel,

Sorry to hear that. You've got a predominately tactical orientated sets of games there - have you looked at the Conflict of Heroes board game as it's got a pretty innovative solo expansion? 

Playing a physical game can be more rewarding sometimes than sitting in front of a computer as your imagination tends to work harder. Maybe it's just the fun of rolling dice to get an outcome rather than 'clicking' on a button to get the same.

Cheers,
Cameron
