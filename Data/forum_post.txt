Hi Budd,

[quote]Lancer so anything you can share about plans for the DC series? I remember there was going to be an announcement and then the plans changed. [/quote]

Yep, plans have changed. Vic is currently busy making his 'Shadow Empires' game. He'd be the best person to tell you about it but, from what I gather, it's Scifi, random maps and groggy with some things streamlined.

The Decisive Campaigns series belongs to Vic. He made the first couple and I made Barbarossa (with his help, Vic did the AI) using his engine.

I'm no longer involved with VR Designs apart from supporting Barbarossa. Whether Vic is eventually going to circle back around and make another DC game after Shadow Empires or perhaps get somebody else to do one, as I did, is another question best asked of Vic.

Cheers,
Cameron

Hi Rommel,

Sorry to hear that. You've got a predominately tactical orientated sets of games there - have you looked at the Conflict of Heroes board game as it's got a pretty innovative solo expansion? 

Playing a physical game can be more rewarding sometimes than sitting in front of a computer as your imagination tends to work harder. Maybe it's just the fun of rolling dice to get an outcome rather than 'clicking' on a button to get the same.

Cheers,
Cameron
