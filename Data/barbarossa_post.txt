Hi Gribeauval,

Guard units come into the category of 'frills', or 'nice-to-have' features,  none of which had any significant affect on the outocme of Barbarossa in '41. I had a big list of these and a lot of them made it into the game. A lot didn't.

The game has had two years of development prior to release. It's aimed at a tiny, shrinking, niche market.  The actual work involved in adding a set of 'frills' isn't that great but there is a heck of a lot of testing and rebalancing that would be needed as the game is nicely tuned at present and anything new thrown into the mix has a good chance of knocking that out of kilter. My experience to date is that they can bite you on on the bum in unexpected ways.

Will new features will be introduced into the game as time goes on? [i]Maybe[/i]. Best I can do.

Cheers,
Cameron
