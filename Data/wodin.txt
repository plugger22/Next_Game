Hi Wodin,

Many thanks for the offer and for your support and enthusiasm throughout. The best publicity the game got was through you contacting Tim Stone at RPS.

Sadly the economics for me to do another game are pretty dire. There is an enormous amount of time and effort required and by the time I pay Steam (a big chunk), Slitherine (an even bigger chunk of the remainder after Steam's cut) and Vic (a very big chunk of whatever's left for the use of his engine) there's not enough left to make it viable. Not even close.

I had fun making Barbarossa but I've got a family to support and have to move on.

The economics work better for Vic and you could approach him although he has a different way of making wargames to me - he's more of a mechanics and numbers guy whereas I'm a people and decisions one. Not that one approach is any better than the other, just that they differ.

Cheers,
Cameron
