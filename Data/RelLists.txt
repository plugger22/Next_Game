[Major_House_Good]
Helped out in times of Trouble
Saved the day in a past Battle
Blood bonds forged between past Lords
Gifted lands to our House
Proved to be a reliable ally on many past occasions
Foiled an evil plot against a past Lord
Provided valuable Political support in previous councils
A valued, long term trading partner
Saved the life of one of our Ancestral Lords on a hunting trip
Saved the life of one of our past Lords during a bandit attack
Provided a good education to wards of the House
A strong friendship existed between past Lords of both Houses

[Major_House_Bad]
An ancestral Lord was humiliated by their daughter being spurned at the Altar
The child ward of a past Lord was murdered while in their care
Accused of Stealing herds of our Livestock
Raided our lands and carried off women from our villages
Fought a small skirmish with us over disputed land
Abandoned a past Lord, in his time of need, on the field of Battle
Allegedly attempted to infiltrate an Assassin into the court of an Ancestral Lord
Engaged in a long standing blood feud
Contested our claim of ownership to a valuable parcel of land
Claim our Lands by virtue of a distant, dubious, marriage
Rumoured to mate with livestock as a disgusting rite-of-passage
