1199 The Battle of Kingskeep (loc 18:15)
King Theon Stark, with an air of desperation, made a last stand with his remaining 11,700 loyal men at arms at The Battle of Kingskeep. Like voice of doom, Lord Harys Greyjoy hurled a Royalist force 66,000 strong straight at them. 
The King fought with unaccustomed ferocity but it was a dark day of infamy. The rebel Lord Harys Greyjoy entered Kingskeep, slaughtering all those he deemed unworthy, before proclaiming himself King of the Iron Throne and ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Long live the King!
