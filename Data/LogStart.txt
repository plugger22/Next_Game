1199 The Battle of Kingskeep (loc 17:16)
King Tyrek Tully, with naught but hope remaining, made a last stand with his remaining 960 loyal men at arms at The Battle of Kingskeep. Like an evil angel of fire, Lord Farlen Baratheon surged a Royalist force 6,480 strong straight at them. 
The King fought  savagely but it was an exercise in futility. The rebel Lord Farlen Baratheon entered Kingskeep, burning at the stake hundreds of royal sympathisers, before proclaiming himself King of the Iron Throne and ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Long live the King!
