1199 The Battle of Kingskeep (loc 17:16)
King Robert Greyjoy, with nothing left to lose, made a last stand with his remaining 18,400 loyal men at arms at The Battle of Kingskeep. Like a roaring, blood-crazed, demon, Lord Andry Arryn flung a Royalist force 86,400 strong straight at them. 
The King fought  savagely but it was inexorably ground down. The rebel Lord Andry Arryn entered Kingskeep, drowning multitudes of loyal royalists like bagged rats thrown into the river, before proclaiming himself King of the Iron Throne and ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Long live the King!
