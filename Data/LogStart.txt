1199 The Siege of Kingskeep (loc 17:14)
King Wyman Stark, with an air of desperation, made a last stand with his remaining 14,100 loyal men at arms at The Siege of Kingskeep. Like a fiery dragon, Lord Stafford Targaryen hurled a Royalist force 73,200 strong straight at them. 
The King fought tenanciously but it was a dark day of infamy. The rebel Lord Stafford Targaryen entered Kingskeep, burning at the stake hundreds of royal sympathisers, before proclaiming himself King of the Iron Throne and ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Long live the King!
