1199 The Battle of Kingskeep (loc 18:15)
King Nestor Tully, with an air of desperation, made a last stand with his remaining 20,000 loyal men at arms at The Battle of Kingskeep. Like voice of doom, Lord Mandon Greyjoy flung a Royalist force 75,600 strong straight at them. 
The King fought like a man possessed but it was a dark day of infamy. The rebel Lord Mandon Greyjoy entered Kingskeep, slaughtering all those he deemed unworthy, before proclaiming himself King of the Iron Throne and ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Long live the King!
