1199 The Siege of Kingskeep (loc 18:14)
King Huchon Arryn, with naught but hope remaining, made a last stand with his remaining 16,200 loyal men at arms at The Siege of Kingskeep. Like the hand of the Devil, Lord Aldis Florent launched a Royalist force 64,800 strong straight at them. 
The King fought ferociously but it was a lost cause. The rebel Lord Aldis Florent entered Kingskeep, impaling anyone who refused to swear fealty to him, before proclaiming himself King of the Iron Throne and ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Long live the King!
