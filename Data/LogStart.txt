1199 The Battle of Kingskeep (loc 16:17)
King Gib Florent, desperate and dangerous, made a last stand with his remaining 20,000 loyal men at arms at The Battle of Kingskeep. Like the hell raised Son of Satan, Lord Will Targaryen flung a Royalist force 75,600 strong straight at them. 
The King fought  savagely but it was an exercise in futility. The rebel Lord Will Targaryen entered Kingskeep, burning at the stake hundreds of royal sympathisers, before proclaiming himself King of the Iron Throne and ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Long live the King!
