1199 The Battle of Kingskeep (loc 16:16)
King Eddard Florent, with naught but hope remaining, made a last stand with his remaining 1,380 loyal men at arms at The Battle of Kingskeep. Like a fiery dragon, Lord Jon Lannister hurled a Royalist force 7,080 strong straight at them. 
The King fought with unaccustomed ferocity but it was inexorably ground down. The rebel Lord Jon Lannister entered Kingskeep, burning at the stake hundreds of royal sympathisers, before proclaiming himself King of the Iron Throne and ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Long live the King!
