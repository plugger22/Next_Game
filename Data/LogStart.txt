Moved to Rebel List
1199 The Battle of Kingskeep (loc 15:17)
King Guarnier Martell, with naught but hope remaining, made a last stand with his remaining 15,600 loyal men at arms at The Battle of Kingskeep. Like a vengeful wraith, Lord Dickon Arryn surged a Royalist force 80,400 strong straight at them. 
The King fought tenanciously but it was inexorably ground down. The rebel Lord Dickon Arryn entered Kingskeep, beheading Royalists wherever he found them, before proclaiming himself King of the Iron Throne and ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Long live the King!
