King Viserys Baratheon, with an air of desperation, made a last stand with his remaining 1,080 loyal men at arms at The Siege of Kingskeep. Like a fiery dragon, Lord Aeron Greyjoy hurled a Royalist force 6,000 strong straight at them. 
The King fought with unaccustomed ferocity but it was a dark day of infamy. The rebel Lord Aeron Greyjoy entered Kingskeep, drowning multitudes of loyal royalists like bagged rats thrown into the river, before proclaiming himself King of the Iron Throne and ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Long live the King!
