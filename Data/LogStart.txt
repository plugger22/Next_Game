1199 The Battle of Kingskeep (loc 12:16)
King Varamyr Greyjoy, with naught but hope remaining, made a last stand with his remaining 9,840 loyal men at arms at The Battle of Kingskeep. Like thunder roaring down from the sky, Lord Vayon Tully stormed a Royalist force 76,800 strong straight at them. 
The King fought like a man possessed but it was a dark day of infamy. The rebel Lord Vayon Tully entered Kingskeep, impaling anyone who refused to swear fealty to him, before proclaiming himself King of the Iron Throne and ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Long live the King!
