1199 The Battle of Kingskeep (loc 14:15)
King Frederick Greyjoy, with nothing left to lose, made a last stand with his remaining 25,600 loyal men at arms at The Battle of Kingskeep. Like an evil angel of fire, Lord Mathias Tyrell hurled a Royalist force 94,800 strong straight at them. 
The King fought  savagely but it was an exercise in futility. The rebel Lord Mathias Tyrell entered Kingskeep, slaughtering all those he deemed unworthy, before proclaiming himself King of the Iron Throne and ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Long live the King!
