King Rowan Greyjoy, with his back to the wall, made a last stand with his remaining 2,520 loyal men at arms at The Battle of Kingskeep. Like a rabid, howling hyena, Lord Beuves Lannister surged a Royalist force 7,200 strong straight at them. 
The King fought  savagely but it was an exercise in futility. The rebel Lord Beuves Lannister entered Kingskeep, impaling anyone who refused to swear fealty to him, before proclaiming himself King of the Iron Throne and ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Long live the King!
