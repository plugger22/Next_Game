BannerLord Willis Flint, Aid 90, was captured by the Royalists during The Battle of Skyreach
1199 The Siege of Kingskeep (loc 11:17)
King Galbart Arryn, with a failing kingdom before him, made a last stand with his remaining 30,000 loyal men at arms at The Siege of Kingskeep. Like a lightning apostole from above, Lord Gilibertus Baratheon threw a Royalist force 96,000 strong straight at them. 
The King fought ferociously but it was an exercise in futility. The rebel Lord Gilibertus Baratheon entered Kingskeep, drowning multitudes of loyal royalists like bagged rats thrown into the river, before proclaiming himself King of the Iron Throne and ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Long live the King!
