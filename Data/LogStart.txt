BannerLord Ivo Cerwyn, Aid 78, was captured by the Royalists during The Siege of Pyke
1199 The Battle of Kingskeep (loc 13:14)
King Humfredus Greyjoy, with naught but hope remaining, made a last stand with his remaining 11,700 loyal men at arms at The Battle of Kingskeep. Like thunder roaring down from the sky, Lord Peter Lannister threw a Royalist force 63,600 strong straight at them. 
The King fought tenanciously but it was a wasted effort. The rebel Lord Peter Lannister entered Kingskeep, beheading Royalists wherever he found them, before proclaiming himself King of the Iron Throne and ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Long live the King!
