1199 The Siege of Kingskeep (loc 17:15)
King Jarvis Tully, with nothing left to lose, made a last stand with his remaining 1,040 loyal men at arms at The Siege of Kingskeep. Like the hell raised Son of Satan, Lord Guarnier Lannister threw a Royalist force 3,480 strong straight at them. 
The King fought like a man possessed but it was an exercise in futility. The rebel Lord Guarnier Lannister entered Kingskeep, impaling anyone who refused to swear fealty to him, before proclaiming himself King of the Iron Throne and ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Long live the King!
