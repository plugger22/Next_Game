BannerLord Elyes Glover, Aid 89, was wounded by the Royalists during The Siege of Greenstone
1199 The Siege of Kingskeep (loc 15:17)
King Hullen Lannister, with naught but hope remaining, made a last stand with his remaining 30,600 loyal men at arms at The Siege of Kingskeep. Like the hell raised Son of Satan, Lord Ywain Greyjoy launched a Royalist force 76,800 strong straight at them. 
The King fought  savagely but it was an exercise in futility. The rebel Lord Ywain Greyjoy entered Kingskeep, beheading Royalists wherever he found them, before proclaiming himself King of the Iron Throne and ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Long live the King!
