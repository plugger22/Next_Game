BannerLord Rankin Karstark, Aid 99, was wounded by the Royalists during The Battle of Riverrun
1199 The Siege of Kingskeep (loc 17:17)
King Jon Tully, desperate and dangerous, made a last stand with his remaining 22,400 loyal men at arms at The Siege of Kingskeep. Like a roaring, blood-crazed, demon, Lord Kevan Martell flung a Royalist force 81,600 strong straight at them. 
The King fought  savagely but it was inexorably ground down. The rebel Lord Kevan Martell entered Kingskeep, beheading Royalists wherever he found them, before proclaiming himself King of the Iron Throne and ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Long live the King!
