1199 The Siege of Kingskeep (loc 17:16)
King Dickory Tully, with an air of desperation, made a last stand with his remaining 8,700 loyal men at arms at The Siege of Kingskeep. Like a rabid, howling hyena, Lord Benjen Martell flung a Royalist force 54,000 strong straight at them. 
The King fought tenanciously but it was inexorably ground down. The rebel Lord Benjen Martell entered Kingskeep, impaling anyone who refused to swear fealty to him, before proclaiming himself King of the Iron Throne and ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Long live the King!
