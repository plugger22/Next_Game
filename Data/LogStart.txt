BannerLord Hervey Tarly, Aid 85, was wounded by the Royalists during The Siege of Winterfell
1199 The Battle of Kingskeep (loc 12:15)
King Patrek Greyjoy, desperate and dangerous, made a last stand with his remaining 11,520 loyal men at arms at The Battle of Kingskeep. Like the hell raised Son of Satan, Lord Cayn Tyrell pounded a Royalist force 97,200 strong straight at them. 
The King fought with unaccustomed ferocity but it was inexorably ground down. The rebel Lord Cayn Tyrell entered Kingskeep, drowning multitudes of loyal royalists like bagged rats thrown into the river, before proclaiming himself King of the Iron Throne and ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Long live the King!
