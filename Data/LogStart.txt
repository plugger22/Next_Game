Hamlin Targaryen, Aid 65, managed to stand firm with his men and hold the line during The Siege of Riverrun
1199 The Battle of Kingskeep (loc 15:14)
King Gregor Martell, displaying an hitherto unknown reservoir of fortitude, made a last stand with his remaining 18,800 loyal men at arms at The Battle of Kingskeep. Like a rabid, howling hyena, Lord Dickon Florent threw a Royalist force 82,800 strong straight at them. 
The King fought tenanciously but it was to no avail. The rebel Lord Dickon Florent entered Kingskeep, slaughtering all those he deemed unworthy, before proclaiming himself King of the Iron Throne and ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Long live the King!
