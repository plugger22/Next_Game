1199 The Battle of Kingskeep (loc 15:13)
King Eddard Baratheon, with his back to the wall, made a last stand with his remaining 1,920 loyal men at arms at The Battle of Kingskeep. Like a lightning apostole from above, Lord Charles Martell launched a Royalist force 4,800 strong straight at them. 
The King fought tenanciously but it was to no avail. The rebel Lord Charles Martell entered Kingskeep, burning at the stake hundreds of royal sympathisers, before proclaiming himself King of the Iron Throne and ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Long live the King!
