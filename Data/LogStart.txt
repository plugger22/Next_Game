1199 The Battle of Kingskeep (loc 15:16)
King Donnel Targaryen, desperate and dangerous, made a last stand with his remaining 20,400 loyal men at arms at The Battle of Kingskeep. Like a vengeful wraith, Lord Bernier Lannister surged a Royalist force 80,400 strong straight at them. 
The King fought with unaccustomed ferocity but it was a lost cause. The rebel Lord Bernier Lannister entered Kingskeep, impaling anyone who refused to swear fealty to him, before proclaiming himself King of the Iron Throne and ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Long live the King!
