1199 The Siege of Kingskeep (loc 13:14)
King Mandon Arryn, with nothing left to lose, made a last stand with his remaining 15,900 loyal men at arms at The Siege of Kingskeep. Like the hell raised Son of Satan, Lord Hunfridus Martell thrust a Royalist force 63,600 strong straight at them. 
The King fought tenanciously but it was a dark day of infamy. The rebel Lord Hunfridus Martell entered Kingskeep, slaughtering all those he deemed unworthy, before proclaiming himself King of the Iron Throne and ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Long live the King!
