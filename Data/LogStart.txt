1199 The Battle of Kingskeep (loc 19:16)
King Nestor Tully, desperate and dangerous, made a last stand with his remaining 15,600 loyal men at arms at The Battle of Kingskeep. Like voice of doom, Lord Jaques Martell flung a Royalist force 70,800 strong straight at them. 
The King fought like a man possessed but it was inexorably ground down. The rebel Lord Jaques Martell entered Kingskeep, impaling anyone who refused to swear fealty to him, before proclaiming himself King of the Iron Throne and ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Long live the King!
