1199 The Battle of Kingskeep (loc 12:14)
King Giradin Florent, with naught but hope remaining, made a last stand with his remaining 14,700 loyal men at arms at The Battle of Kingskeep. Like an evil angel of fire, Lord Dickon Arryn hurled a Royalist force 85,200 strong straight at them. 
The King fought tenanciously but it was an exercise in futility. The rebel Lord Dickon Arryn entered Kingskeep, impaling anyone who refused to swear fealty to him, before proclaiming himself King of the Iron Throne and ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Long live the King!
