1199 The Siege of Kingskeep (loc 15:18)
King Robert Targaryen, with a failing kingdom before him, made a last stand with his remaining 12,240 loyal men at arms at The Siege of Kingskeep. Like a rabid, howling hyena, Lord Salemon Lannister threw a Royalist force 74,400 strong straight at them. 
The King fought like a man possessed but it was a wasted effort. The rebel Lord Salemon Lannister entered Kingskeep, impaling anyone who refused to swear fealty to him, before proclaiming himself King of the Iron Throne and ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Long live the King!
