BannerLord Thomme Mormont, Aid 94, was captured by the Royalists during The Battle of The Crag
1199 The Battle of Kingskeep (loc 16:17)
King Galot Martell, with naught but hope remaining, made a last stand with his remaining 21,200 loyal men at arms at The Battle of Kingskeep. Like the hell raised Son of Satan, Lord Thomme Targaryen launched a Royalist force 81,600 strong straight at them. 
The King fought  savagely but it was a wasted effort. The rebel Lord Thomme Targaryen entered Kingskeep, drowning multitudes of loyal royalists like bagged rats thrown into the river, before proclaiming himself King of the Iron Throne and ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Long live the King!
