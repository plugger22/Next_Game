1199 The Siege of Kingskeep (loc 16:15)
King Robert Greyjoy, with a failing kingdom before him, made a last stand with his remaining 1,230 loyal men at arms at The Siege of Kingskeep. Like the hell raised Son of Satan, Lord Walder Lannister thrust a Royalist force 6,360 strong straight at them. 
The King fought like a man possessed but it was a wasted effort. The rebel Lord Walder Lannister entered Kingskeep, impaling anyone who refused to swear fealty to him, before proclaiming himself King of the Iron Throne and ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Long live the King!
