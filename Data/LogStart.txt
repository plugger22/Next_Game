BannerLord Aerys Penrose, Aid 87, was wounded by the Royalists during The Siege of Dorne
1199 The Battle of Kingskeep (loc 14:18)
King Gylbard Arryn, with a failing kingdom before him, made a last stand with his remaining 20,800 loyal men at arms at The Battle of Kingskeep. Like the hand of the Devil, Lord Frank Targaryen pounded a Royalist force 68,400 strong straight at them. 
The King fought tenanciously but it was a dark day of infamy. The rebel Lord Frank Targaryen entered Kingskeep, slaughtering all those he deemed unworthy, before proclaiming himself King of the Iron Throne and ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Long live the King!
