1199 The Battle of Kingskeep (loc 14:18)
King Humfredus Baratheon, with naught but hope remaining, made a last stand with his remaining 34,800 loyal men at arms at The Battle of Kingskeep. Like an unstoppable force of change, Lord Heward Arryn hurled a Royalist force 86,400 strong straight at them. 
The King fought  savagely but it was a dark day of infamy. The rebel Lord Heward Arryn entered Kingskeep, beheading Royalists wherever he found them, before proclaiming himself King of the Iron Throne and ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Long live the King!
