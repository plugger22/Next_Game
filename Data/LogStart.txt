1199 The Battle of Kingskeep (loc 17:14)
King Stafford Tully, with an air of desperation, made a last stand with his remaining 20,000 loyal men at arms at The Battle of Kingskeep. Like an unstoppable force of change, Lord Oggery Greyjoy stormed a Royalist force 84,000 strong straight at them. 
The King fought with unaccustomed ferocity but it was a wasted effort. The rebel Lord Oggery Greyjoy entered Kingskeep, burning at the stake hundreds of royal sympathisers, before proclaiming himself King of the Iron Throne and ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Long live the King!
