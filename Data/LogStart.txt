1199 The Battle of Kingskeep (loc 17:15)
King Trystane Tully, with his back to the wall, made a last stand with his remaining 40,200 loyal men at arms at The Battle of Kingskeep. Like an evil angel of fire, Lord Morton Martell stormed a Royalist force 97,200 strong straight at them. 
The King fought with unaccustomed ferocity but it was a dark day of infamy. The rebel Lord Morton Martell entered Kingskeep, burning at the stake hundreds of royal sympathisers, before proclaiming himself King of the Iron Throne and ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Long live the King!
