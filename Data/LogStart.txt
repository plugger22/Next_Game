1199 The Siege of Kingskeep (loc 15:17)
King David Stark, displaying an hitherto unknown reservoir of fortitude, made a last stand with his remaining 1,560 loyal men at arms at The Siege of Kingskeep. Like the hell raised Son of Satan, Lord Huchon Baratheon thrust a Royalist force 4,080 strong straight at them. 
The King fought  savagely but it was to no avail. The rebel Lord Huchon Baratheon entered Kingskeep, burning at the stake hundreds of royal sympathisers, before proclaiming himself King of the Iron Throne and ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Long live the King!
