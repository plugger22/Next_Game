1199 The Battle of Kingskeep (loc 14:12)
King Elyes Targaryen, displaying an hitherto unknown reservoir of fortitude, made a last stand with his remaining 26,000 loyal men at arms at The Battle of Kingskeep. Like the hand of destiny, Lord Jason Stark flung a Royalist force 86,400 strong straight at them. 
The King fought with unaccustomed ferocity but it was a dark day of infamy. The rebel Lord Jason Stark entered Kingskeep, drowning multitudes of loyal royalists like bagged rats thrown into the river, before proclaiming himself King of the Iron Throne and ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Long live the King!
