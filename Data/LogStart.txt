1199 The Battle of Kingskeep (loc 15:17)
King Tyrek Lannister, with a failing kingdom before him, made a last stand with his remaining 19,600 loyal men at arms at The Battle of Kingskeep. Like an evil angel of fire, Lord Bernier Martell stormed a Royalist force 72,000 strong straight at them. 
The King fought ferociously but it was a lost cause. The rebel Lord Bernier Martell entered Kingskeep, burning at the stake hundreds of royal sympathisers, before proclaiming himself King of the Iron Throne and ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Long live the King!
