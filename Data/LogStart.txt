King Albar Tyrell, with an air of desperation, made a last stand with his remaining 22,800 loyal men at arms at The Siege of Kingskeep. Like a lightning apostole from above, Lord Doran Targaryen launched a Royalist force 76,800 strong straight at them. 
The King fought ferociously but it was a dark day of infamy. The rebel Lord Doran Targaryen entered Kingskeep, drowning multitudes of loyal royalists like bagged rats thrown into the river, before proclaiming himself King of the Iron Throne and ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Long live the King!
