1199 The Battle of Kingskeep (loc 17:16)
King Morton Tully, desperate and dangerous, made a last stand with his remaining 2,580 loyal men at arms at The Battle of Kingskeep. Like the hell raised Son of Satan, Lord Dick Baratheon threw a Royalist force 6,120 strong straight at them. 
The King fought ferociously but it was a lost cause. The rebel Lord Dick Baratheon entered Kingskeep, impaling anyone who refused to swear fealty to him, before proclaiming himself King of the Iron Throne and ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Long live the King!
