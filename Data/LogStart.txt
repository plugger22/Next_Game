BannerLord Viserys Tarly, Aid 80, was captured by the Royalists during The Battle of Brightwater Keep
1199 The Battle of Kingskeep (loc 12:14)
King Urian Tyrell, with his back to the wall, made a last stand with his remaining 27,000 loyal men at arms at The Battle of Kingskeep. Like a fiery dragon, Lord Andry Martell surged a Royalist force 62,400 strong straight at them. 
The King fought tenanciously but it was a lost cause. The rebel Lord Andry Martell entered Kingskeep, drowning multitudes of loyal royalists like bagged rats thrown into the river, before proclaiming himself King of the Iron Throne and ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Long live the King!
