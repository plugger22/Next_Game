1199 The Battle of Kingskeep (loc 14:13)
King Albar Stark, with a failing kingdom before him, made a last stand with his remaining 18,000 loyal men at arms at The Battle of Kingskeep. Like a roaring, blood-crazed, demon, Lord Houdouyn Lannister launched a Royalist force 97,200 strong straight at them. 
The King fought ferociously but it was to no avail. The rebel Lord Houdouyn Lannister entered Kingskeep, drowning multitudes of loyal royalists like bagged rats thrown into the river, before proclaiming himself King of the Iron Throne and ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Long live the King!
