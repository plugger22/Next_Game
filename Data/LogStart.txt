1199 The Battle of Kingskeep (loc 15:17)
King Cleos Stark, desperate and dangerous, made a last stand with his remaining 12,000 loyal men at arms at The Battle of Kingskeep. Like thunder roaring down from the sky, Lord Eddard Greyjoy thrust a Royalist force 80,400 strong straight at them. 
The King fought tenanciously but it was a vain attempt. The rebel Lord Eddard Greyjoy entered Kingskeep, beheading Royalists wherever he found them, before proclaiming himself King of the Iron Throne and ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Long live the King!
