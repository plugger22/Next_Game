1199 The Battle of Kingskeep (loc 14:12)
King Randyll Tyrell, with nothing left to lose, made a last stand with his remaining 14,400 loyal men at arms at The Battle of Kingskeep. Like the hand of destiny, Lord Victarion Arryn flung a Royalist force 61,200 strong straight at them. 
The King fought with unaccustomed ferocity but it was to no avail. The rebel Lord Victarion Arryn entered Kingskeep, beheading Royalists wherever he found them, before proclaiming himself King of the Iron Throne and ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Long live the King!
