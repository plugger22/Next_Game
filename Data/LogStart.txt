1199 The Battle of Kingskeep (loc 16:15)
King Heward Baratheon, with a failing kingdom before him, made a last stand with his remaining 15,360 loyal men at arms at The Battle of Kingskeep. Like a vengeful wraith, Lord Rowan Stark pounded a Royalist force 75,600 strong straight at them. 
The King fought tenanciously but it was an exercise in futility. The rebel Lord Rowan Stark entered Kingskeep, drowning multitudes of loyal royalists like bagged rats thrown into the river, before proclaiming himself King of the Iron Throne and ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Long live the King!
