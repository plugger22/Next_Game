Under the dubious leadership of the Rebel Lord Renoldus Greyjoy his 3,600 men at arms marched on a Royalist force of 1,960 at The Battle of Maidenpool. 
King Nestor Arryn's insipid and uninspiring direction succeeded only in issuing a succession of fumbled orders that added to the confusion and the inevitable defeat.

The King fought tenanciously but it was an exercise in futility. The rebel Lord Renoldus Greyjoy entered Kingskeep, burning at the stake hundreds of royal sympathisers, before proclaiming himself King of the Iron Throne and ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. Long live the King!
