# Combat -> Battle ---

Skill: Leadership
Type: Combat
SubType: Battle
PlyrDef: 1
Data: 0
Good1: You stand tall in the stirrups and rally your men. The give a rousing cheer in response.
Good2: Racing to the threatened sector your presence serves to raise the moral of your men and firm up the defences.
Good3: You've kept men back in reserve. Judging when to use them is the key. You get it right.
Bad1: Your men are looking at your expectantly, awaiting a speech or a sign of confidence. You ignore them.
Bad2: Every battle has a pivot point where clear, firm leadership can swing the day. You must have missed it.
Bad3: Deploy your reserves? What reserves? Winners don't need reserves although they could come in handy now.
[End]

Skill: Leadership
Type: Combat
SubType: Battle
PlyrDef: -1
Data: 0
Good1: You ride along the line of men and rouse them to greater feats of martial derring-do with your fierce oratory.
Good2: You pause to take in the ebb and flow of the battle and weigh up the odds. There's an opportunity there...
Good3: A fired up attacker is a fearsome site, running howling into battle. You do your utmost to energise them all the more.
Bad1: It's difficult to judge the success of the attack when you are so far back from the action. Caution is costing you dearly.
Bad2: Your men are looking to you for firm leadership but you seem fixated on posing in the saddle for an imaginary artist.
Bad3: Decisions are tough. Get it wrong and everybody blames you. Best to not make it in the first place.
[End]

Skill: Leadership
Type: Combat
SubType: Battle
PlyrDef: 1
Data: 1
Good1: You can see <name> shouting orders and waving his arms . Careful observation gives you a few clues as to his intentions.
Good2: You point out <name>, attired in <his> fancy suit of armour, to your men. They laugh as you refer to the 'golden peacock'.
Good3: You refuse to be intimidated by <name>. <He> couldn't lead a herd of goats to water, let alone an attacking army.
Bad1: The trouble with defending is that you find yourself constantly reacting to <name> as he manoeuvres his army to best advantage.
Bad2: It would be a lot easier to hold firm if <name> stop issuing orders. Doesn't <he> have something better to do today?
Bad3: You're frustrated. You issue an order and even before it's implemented <name> has countered it with a sudden assault. 
[End]

Skill: Leadership
Type: Combat
SubType: Battle
PlyrDef: -1
Data: 1
Good1: You immediately shift the focus of your attack as <name> appears to reshuffle his defences. 
Good2: <men> look weary and flat footed. You shout encouragement as your troops surge forward.
Good3: Does <name> know what he his doing? Given his lacklustre leadership, apparently not. His men appear confused.
Bad1: Is it possible that you're being out-generaled today? <name> looks to have a better grasp of the battle than you do.
Bad2: How can you push forward a successful assault when <name> keeps repositioning his forces to block you? Can he read your mind?
Bad3: It's tough to admit but <name> looks to be doing a better job of defending than you are of attacking. Curse <him>.

# Combat -> Personal ---

Type: Combat
SubType: Personal
PlyrDef: 1
Data: 0
Good1: You block and parry <name>'s attacks as if they were bloatflies just waiting to be swatted.
Good2: In a blur of moving arms and steel you fend of <name> and launch a stinging counter attack.
Good3: <name> has no answer to your raging martial prowess. You are a tiger in full flight.
Bad1: There is a lethargy about you today that is holding back your undoubted fighting abilities. Was it last night's dinner?
Bad2: Is there an imposter in your skin today? Why are you restraining yourself? What's wrong?
Bad3: You realise that you strongly dislike defending. You are a natural born attacker. You feel restricted. Constrained. Chained up.
[End]

Skill: Combat
Type: Combat
SubType: Personal
PlyrDef: -1
Data: 0
Good1: You don't think, you simply move and your steel is THERE, on target. <name> is bruised, battered and worried.
Good2: Lunging forward you knock <name>'s weapon to one side. <He> is yours for the taking, defenceless and vulnerable.
Good3: With a wild flurry of blows you force <name> further back. <He> manages to block your thrusts and slashes, but only some.
Bad1: You are supposed to be attacking yet here you are on the back foot fending off <name>'s blows.
Bad2: Your attack has all the enthusiasm of a thief for the hangman's noose. It's hard to get as excited as <name> clearly is.
Bad3: It's a full moon. You shouldn't have picked a fight on a full moon. You put the minimum effort into your attack. Best not to offend anyone. 
[End]

Good1: <name> wields his weapon as if <he> is plowing a field. Does <he> think that you're a potato who just happens to be holding a steel weapon?
Good2: Your sustained defence has caused <name> to break out into a heavy sweat. Any more and they are liable to collapse at your feet from exhaustion.
Good3: <name> is struggling to get past your blocks and parries. Perhaps you are too good for them?
Bad1: <name> lands blow after blow. You struggle to fend off the incessant assault. As good as you are <he> appears to be better.
Bad2: Your weapon arm goes heavy and your movements lethargic. <name>'s flurry of blows have exhausted your reservoir of stamina.
Bad3: How much longer can you keep defending in the face of <name>'s fierce assault? You feel your strength ebbing away.
[End]

Skill: Combat

Good1: <name>'s efforts at blocking your lunges and thrusts appear futile. It'll be a short fight.
Good2: For somebody on the defence, <name> seems to be overly confident. You hammer into them and wait for the right moment.
Good3: <name> fights on but you can tell that they are weakening. You block all but <his> most unexpected counter-attacks.
Bad1: How can <name> keep holding you off with such vigour? You feel as if you are dressed in a lead suit that's anchored to the ground.
Bad2: Your aggressive thrusts have faltered in the face of <name>'s fierce defence and even fiercer counter-attacks. You're in trouble.
Bad3: It's supposed to be you who is landing the slashing blows, not <name>. <He> should defending, not leaping at you like a wild animal.

# Combat -> Tournament (player as anonymous entry -> challenger, player as Usurper -> defender) ---

Skill: Combat
Type: Combat
SubType: Tournament
PlyrDef: 1
Data: 0
Good1: You ride down the jousting lane and wield your lance like a giant spear of doom. <name> topples from <his> horse.
Good2: It's all about instinct and timing. You've got it and that's why it's <name> flying backwards out of <his> saddle and not you.
Good3: <name> should yield now. How many times can they take being knocked off the horse and being flung face down into the dirt?
Bad1: Your timing is off. Not by much but enough that your lance misses <name>'s torso and glances harmlessly off to one side.
Bad2: Crack! Your lance shatters as you failed to properly couch it before galloping down the jousting lane towards <name>.
Bad3: You blink your eyes and try and stop seeing two of <name>. Dealing with one of them is bad enough. You feel hot and sweaty inside your armour.
[End]

Skill: Combat
Type: Combat
SubType: Tournament
PlyrDef: -1
Data: 0
Good1: Spurring your horse into a fast gallop you wallop your lance squarely into <name>'s chest. <He> is jerked off his horse as if suddenly pulled.
Good2: Jousting is all about momentum. Right now it's on your side. You leave <name> eating dirt behind you as you slow your horse to a canter.
Good3: The crowd gasps as the point of your lance finds the front of <name>'s protective face plate. It's not easy to hit such a small, moving target.
Bad1: Your horse twitches underneath you, letting you know that he'd like to step it up. Why haven't you? What's wrong?
Bad2: Ahhh-Choooo! It's either the dust or the pollen count but either way your eyes are watering and you can't stop sneezing inside your helmet.
Bad3: The suit of armour they've given you doesn't quite fit. It chafes and bites, unsettling you and disturbing your concentration. 
[End]

Skill: Combat

Data: 1
Good1: <name> couldn't hit the side of a castle wall if it was right in front of him. You receive glancing blows but that's all.
Good2: You swerve your horse at the last moment and <name>'s lance strikes a glancing blow. You manage to stay in the saddle.
Good3: <name>'s lance keeps searching for your chest plate but you fend it off with your shield.
Bad1: <name>'s lance finds you unprepared and you find yourself being roughly jerked out of the saddle.
Bad2: With casual ease, <name> lowers his lance and takes you firmly in the chest. That's dirt that you're eating.
Bad3: You wonder how you found yourself sprawled in the dirt as you can't remember <name> hitting you with <his> lance. It must have been the wind.
[End]

PlyrDef: -1
Data: 1
Good1: <name> has had more than <his> fair share of luck today but, even though you've been hit, you remain mounted, ready for the next round.
Good2: You breath a sigh of relief as <name> cracks <his> lance on your side armour. Your armour has survived intact but <his> lance hasn't.
Good3: By leaning outwards you manage to miss <name>'s lunging lance tip although it was a close call.
Bad1: Whump! Your head snaps backwards as <name>'s lance takes you in the neck. Your protective armour does it's job but you topple from your horse.
Bad2: Your body is still store from your previous unhorsing. It likes being knocked out of the saddle by <name>'s lance even less this time around.
Bad3: You're trying your best but every gallop down the jousting lane leaves you face down in the dirt and <name> mounted and waving to the crowd.
[End]

# Social -> Blackmail ---

Skill: Treachery
Type: Social
SubType: Blackmail
PlyrDef: 1
Data: 0
Good1: You refuse to heel to <name>'s threats and bluster. You are the rightful ruler of the land, not some easily manipulated lackey.
Good2: <name> might think that they can push you in any direction but <he> doesn't realise that you are an immovable force of nature.
Good3: Threats! Who is <name> to threaten you? What do they know of hardship and travail? You laugh at <his> feeble effort.
Bad1: You have dealt with blackmailers before but you're not paying close enough attention and feel the ground sliding beneath you.
Bad2: It's difficult to deal with odious blackmailing b*stards when you aren't feeling your best.
Bad3: You refuse to concede to <name>'s threats but you find yourself giving ground on the smaller points.
[End]

Skill: Treachery
Type: Social
SubType: Blackmail
PlyrDef: -1
Data: 0
Good1: Like a worm on a hook, <name> wriggles this way and that but to no avail. The hook is firmly set.
Good2: <name> may lay claim to a higher moral code but you know that they are slowly being squeezed under your snake-like embrace.
Good3: Manipulation is the key. <name> is nothing but a lump of clay in your hands, waiting patiently to be shaped and moulded.
Bad1: You're not on top of your game today. Your subtle threats have been taken as crude cudgels. You can do better.
Bad2: There is something about <name> that is making it difficult for you to press home your case. Surely you don't care about them?
Bad3: In the blustering storm of threat and counter-threat you've lost track of who said what. Focus!

Data: 1
Good1: <name> is gradually weakening your resolve but you stand firm for now.
Good2: You can tell that <name> is becoming frustrated at your reticence but that's how it should be.
Good3: You prevaricate and avoid, enough to fend off <name>'s threats for now.
Bad1: Your resistance crumbles in the face of <name> relentless threats. 
Bad2: <name> is master of the indirect threat. Before you realise it you are nodding your head.
Bad3: What can you do when faced with such an experienced manipulator? <name> has you over a barrel. 
[End]

Skill: Treachery

PlyrDef: -1
Data: 1
Good1: <name> is a slippery customer but you manage to get your point across.
Good2: While <name> isn't yet agreeing to your demands they are at least giving them serious consideration.
Good3: <name> doesn't give ground easily but you feel that you've made an impact.
Bad1: You cajole and threaten but <name> appears to be paying you little heed. It's incredibly annoying.
Bad2: Threatening <name> is like p*ssing into the wind. Everything you aim at them gets thrown straight back at you.
Bad3: You are beginning to realise the futility of attempting to threaten <name>. Are they incorruptible?
[End]

# Social -> Seduce ---

Skill: Charm
Type: Social
SubType: Seduce
PlyrDef: 1
Data: 0
Good1: <name> come hither looks and sultry charm fail to arose your interest.
Good2: It's hard to get excited by <name> when they won't acknowledge your birthright.
Good3: You try to imagine what it would be like to wake up next to <name> and cringe at the mental image the thought conjures up.
Bad1: You know that you should resist but, by the heavenly light of the Golden Gods, isn't <he> lovely?
Bad2: The allure of <name> physical presence is strong and growing. Your weakening. 
Bad3: As the rightful ruler of the land you should be able to exercise great self control but right now you're not so sure.
[End]

Skill: Charm
Type: Social
SubType: Seduce
PlyrDef: -1
Data: 0
Good1: You touch <name> on the hand, the arm, the neck. You feel the glow from <his> skin, the heat of <his> body.
Good2: <name> wilts at your touch, laughs at your jokes and sighs when you blow sweet nothings into <his> ear.
Good3: Seizing the moment you lean forward and kiss <name> passionately on <his> lips.
Bad1: Your approaches are being repelled but with less force each time.
Bad2: You chance a sneak kiss only to have <name> pull back although with a smile on <his> face.
Bad3: <name> suddenly slaps hard but tellingly remains within kissing distance.
