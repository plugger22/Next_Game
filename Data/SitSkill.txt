Good1: You ride along the line of men and rouse them to greater feats of martial derring-do with your fierce oratory.
Good2: You pause to take in the ebb and flow of the battle and weigh up the odds. There's an opportunity there...
Good3: A fired up attacker is a fearsome site, running howling into battle. You do your utmost to energise them all the more.
Bad1: It's difficult to judge the success of the attack when you are so far back from the action. Caution is costing you dearly.
Bad2: Your men are looking to you for firm leadership but you seem fixated on posing in the saddle for an imaginary artist.
Bad3: Decisions are tough. Get it wrong and everybody blames you. Best to not make it in the first place.
