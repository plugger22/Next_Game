Good1: You stand tall in the stirrups and rally your men. The give a rousing cheer in response.
Good2: Racing to the threatened sector your presence serves to raise the moral of your men and firm up the defences.
Good3: You've kept men back in reserve. Judging when to use them is the key. You get it right.
Bad1: Your men are looking at your expectantly, awaiting a speech or a sign of confidence. You ignore them.
Bad2: Every battle has a pivot point where clear, firm leadership can swing the day. You must have missed it.
Bad3: Deploy your reserves? What reserves? Winners don't need reserves although they could come in handy now.

Good1: You ride along the line of men and rouse them to greater feats of martial derring-do with your fierce oratory.
Good2: You pause to take in the ebb and flow of the battle and weigh up the odds. There's an opportunity there...
Good3: A fired up attacker is a fearsome site, running howling into battle. You do your utmost to energise them all the more.
Bad1: It's difficult to judge the success of the attack when you are so far back from the action. Caution is costing you dearly.
Bad2: Your men are looking to you for firm leadership but you seem fixated on posing in the saddle for an imaginary artist.
Bad3: Decisions are tough. Get it wrong and everybody blames you. Best to not make it in the first place.

Good1: You can see <name> shouting orders and waving his arms . Careful observation gives you a few clues as to his intentions.
Good2: You point out <name>, attired in their fancy suit of armour, to your men. They laugh as you refer to the 'golden peacock'.
Good3: You refuse to be intimidated by <name>. <He> couldn't lead a herd of goats to water, let alone an attacking army.
Bad1: The trouble with defending is that you find yourself constantly reacting to <name> as he manoeuvres his army to best advantage.
Bad2: It would be a lot easier to hold firm if <name> stop issuing orders. Doesn't <he> have something better to do today?
Bad3: You're frustrated. You issue an order and even before it's implemented <name> has countered it with a sudden assault.

Good1: You immediately shift the focus of your attack as <name> appears to reshuffle his defences. 
Good2: <men> look weary and flat footed. You shout encouragement as your troops surge forward.
Good3: Does <name> know what he his doing? Given his lacklustre leadership, apparently not. His men appear confused.
Bad1: Is it possible that you're being out-generaled today? <name> looks to have a better grasp of the battle than you do.
Bad2: How can you push forward a successful assault when <name> keeps repositioning his forces to block you? Can he read your mind?
Bad3: It's tough to admit but <name> looks to be doing a better job of defending than you are of attacking. Curse <him>.
