[JusticeNeutralEduc]
Does <player> have a right to be King? Hard to say

[JusticeNeutralUned]
Kings are all the same. Who cares if it's <player> or King <newKing>?

[JusticeGoodEduc]
Yes, of course <player>, the Usurper, should be King. It's <his> birthright.

[JusticeGoodUned]
"So <player> thinks that they should be King? Doesn't everybody?

[JusticeBadEduc]
King <newKing> sits rightfully upon the throne. <player> is nothing but an imposter

[JusticeBadUned]
King <newKing> is the King and good on him. <player> is fit for nothing more than pig swill

[LegendNeutralEduc]
I never did go much on Old King <oldKing> but I don't like <newKing> either

[LegendNeutralUned]
<player>? Who's he?
Everybody is a legend in their own mind. I bet <player> thinks <he> is a God. Pigs *ss.

[LegendGoodEduc]
Didn't the <player>, the Usurper, once kill a lion with <his> bare hands?

[LegendGoodUned]
That heir, <player>, <he> will chew King <newKing>'s head off before breakfast

[LegendBadEduc]
<player>, the so called Usurper, I heard the <he> was frightened to get out of bed in the morning

[LegendBadUned]
King <newKing> will piss all over <player>. Everybody knows that.

[HonourNeutralEduc]
Who can you trust more? King <newKing> or the Usurper, <player>

[HonourNeutralUned]
Kings and Usurpers treat you like dirt. The pox on all of them

[HonourGoodEduc]
<player> is a <man> you can rely on. The sooner <he> takes over from King <newKing>, the better.

[HonourGoodUned]
Can I rely on that Usurper, <player> to make my life better? I hear that you can trust <him>.

[HonourBadEduc]
King <newKing>'s word can be relied upon. I trust him.

[HonourBadUned]
Why would I want to trust <player>, the pretend King? Nobody else does.

[KnownEduc]
They say that the Usurper, <player>, was seen in <locRecent> recently. What is <he> up to?

[KnownUned]
The Usurper, <player>. Isn't he at <locRecent>?
I heard that <player> had visited <locRandom> once. Maybe <he> liked the ale?
<randomMale> from the village swore that he'd seen <player> at <locRandom>.

[UnknownEduc]
Who knows where <player> is? I heard the Inquisitors were asking after <him>.

[UnknownUned]
Do I care where <player> is? Does <he> know who I am and what my problems are? If you see <him> make sure you tell <him>.
I overheard <randomFemale> talking about <player> the other day. She sure knows how to curse.
