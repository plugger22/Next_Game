Good3: A larger army can sway the day but your men are fighting as if there were two for each of them.
Bad1: There doesn't appear to be any more enemy Men-At-Arms than you've got but they are fighting harder.
Bad2: The enemy are moving around so much that it's hard to tell how many of them there are. You feel flat footed.
Bad3: If you didn't know better you'd think that enemy has twice as many men as they actually did. They sure know how to fight.

Good2: How many Men-At-Arms does <name> have? It doesn't matter as your men are demon fighters today  .
Good3: <name> superior numbers would count if it wasn't for the nimbleness of your smaller force.
Bad1: You feel that you've been hit on the head by a mace. <men> seem unstoppable.

Good2: If you hadn't made it clear to all that you are a rising star you would be no more known than the King.
Good3: It's a struggle but you manage to make the most of your fame. Around you, support for the King falls away.

Bad2: It's hard to stand tall, proud and famous when the current King keeps crowding you out.
Bad3: What does a man need to do in order to become better known than the odious current King? You have yet to find the answer.
[End]

Good3: It's a constant struggle to gain name recognition with the peasants with the King being so famous but you mange to breakthrough today.

Bad2: You feel like a shadow, constantly tagging along behind the King, hiding behind the arc of his fame.

Good3: The King's honour is a shabby, ragged thing compared to your own.

Good2: When it comes to honour your reputation is no better than that of the King but that's not how it appears today.
Good3: You are a man of honour and people should recognise you as such. Who cares about the King?
Bad1: In a two horse race for the honour stakes you are running a distant second even though there is little to distinguish your honour from that of the King.
Bad2: You abdicate your claim to be the more honourable by neglect. 
Bad3: Why bother? Does it matter who is the more honourable? Let the King be seen as the more upright.

Good3: Your local deeds overcome the people's favouring of the King as the more honourable. To a degree.

Bad2: The sad fact of life is that you are viewed as a scoundrel whereas the King is seen as a man of honour.
Bad3: Despite your best efforts it is the King who is seen as being the most honourable.

Name: Relative Justice
Type: State
SubType: Justice
SitNum: 0
Data: 0
Good1: There is a fine line between a just cause and a cursed one. You place yourself on the right side of the line.
Good2: A just cause is helped by the frequent proclamation of such, even though it's absolute righteousness is no stronger than that of the Kings.
Good3: The King might have an equally valid claim to the throne but you ensure that yours is the one that is front and centre.
Bad1: Despite the validity of both your and the King's claim to the throne it is his that the peasants put more credence in.
Bad2: It is the King's claim to the throne that is the one on most people's lips today, not yours.
Bad3: Your claim to have a just reason for the throne is, sadly, falling on deaf ears. Perhaps you should have spoken up.

Good2: You believe in the righteousness of your cause despite opinion being against you. Your conviction and sincerity wins through, however.
Good3: It is your natural born right to assume the throne from the fake King. Nobody takes you seriously but they take the time to listen.
Bad1: You seem to be a sole voice in the wilderness. All anybody wants to talk about is the current King's righteous claim to the throne, not yours.
Bad2: The King has, according to general opinion, a much stronger claim to the throne than yourself. You make no attempt to dispute this.
Bad3: Is there any justice in the world? It appears not. The King has a firm hold on his throne and the people agree that it is his to sit upon as he wishes.

Data: 0
Good1: You keep a low profile. That's the way you like it.
Good2: As a shadow you move throughout the land, silent and unseen.

Bad2: Why insist that are the rightful King when it is silence and anonymity that you desire?
Bad3: Yes, you have a low profile but not today. Did you have beans for breakfast?

Bad3: They know who you are. What do you expect as you've made no effort to conceal your identity.

Data: 0
Good1: Everybody seems to know you. Or do they? You have them confused, doubting their own eyes. It's a skill.
Good2: Even though you are well known you manage to convince at least some people otherwise.
Good3: You can hear them muttering your name. You raise your head, square your shoulders and proceed to prove them wrong. Not all, but enough.
Bad1: People constantly point their fingers at you, telling their companions that it's the Usurper. You choose to ignore them.
Bad2: It's bl**dy difficult to do anything stealthy when you are so well known.
Bad3: If people didn't keep recognising you it'd be a lot easier to move around unnoticed. Can't the peasants stay indoors?
