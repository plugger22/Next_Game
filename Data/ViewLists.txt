[JusticeNeutralEduc]
Does <player> have a right to be King? Hard to say.
Justice is a relative term. I'd consider that both <player> and King <newKing> have valid claims on the throne.

[JusticeNeutralUned]
Kings are all the same. Who cares if it's <player> or King <newKing>?
Justice, what in <curse> is that? Why should I care about <player> and <his> crown?
So <player> thinks that <he> has a just cause? What about mine? Who's helping me?
Justice, fustice. What in <curse> does it have to do with me? Does any King care about me?

[JusticeGoodEduc]
Yes, of course <player>, the Usurper, should be King. It's <his> birthright.
When your cause is just the wind blows from behind. <player> should set <his> sails.

[JusticeGoodUned]
So <player> thinks that they should be King? Doesn't everybody?
If <player> wants to be King then let <him> win the crown. Justice doesn't count for much around here.
<player> has a right to the throne, does <he>? Where's my right to a decent wage?
Yes, yes, <player> is the rightful King. What in <curse> do you expect me to say?

[JusticeBadEduc]
King <newKing> sits rightfully upon the throne. <player> is nothing but an imposter.
<player>, the Imposter, should stop bothering King <newKing> as <his> cause is unjust and <his> health is a about to worsen.

[JusticeBadUned]
King <newKing> is the King and good on him. <player> is fit for nothing more than pig swill
<player> has as much claim to the crown as I do.
King <newKing> is in charge. He has a god given right to sit upon the throne, not some stranger.
What in <curse> does <player> think <he> is doing? <newKing> is our rightful ruler, not some has been stranger.

[LegendNeutralEduc]
I never did go much on Old King <oldKing> but I don't like the new King <newKing> either
Those who do become legends. Those who don't die. <player> needs to step up.

[LegendNeutralUned]
<player>? Who's he?
Everybody is a legend in their own mind. I bet <player> thinks <he> is a God. Pigs *ss.
A legend you say? Tell me what <player> has done other than fluff around?
I like legends who do things. <player> hasn't done nothin famous, <randomFemale> said so.
What in <curse> am I expected to do? Bow down and worship the great deeds of <player>? Pig's *rse.

[LegendGoodEduc]
Didn't the <player>, the Usurper, once kill a lion with <his> bare hands?
It's said that <player> is a geniune legend but nobody can state why?

[LegendGoodUned]
That heir, <player>, <he> will chew King <newKing>'s balls off before breakfast
They say that <he> sh*ts arrows and farts bolts. <player> sure is a legend around here.
Yeah, <player> is a legend. Ask <randomMale> 'cause he swears that he saw <him> kill a full grown <animalBig> with <his> bare hands.
I consider myself a true legend around here. Just like that <player> person. <He> is one too.

[LegendBadEduc]
<player>, the so called Usurper, I heard the <he> was frightened to crawk out of <his> bed in the morning.
King <newKing> is a real legend. Singlehandedly ate an entire pig at a feast. <player>, you say? Who?

[LegendBadUned]
King <newKing> will piss all over <player>. Everybody knows that.
<player> a Legend? Hah! King <newKing> is a real live legend. He eats babies for breakfast, he does.
I don't know where you got the idea that <player> is a legend? Maybe a maggoty cow pat. <newKing> is the real legend.
King <newKing> is a giant among men. That <player>? Walking worm food.

[HonourNeutralEduc]
Who can you trust more? King <newKing> or the Usurper, <player>
Honour is an important part of a <man>. It's difficult to judge <player> as I don't know <him>.

[HonourNeutralUned]
Kings and Usurpers treat you like dirt. The pox on all of them.
What does it matter if <player> is honourable, or not? Will it put food my my table?
When did honour have anything to do with anything? <player> could be a pig in disguise, for all I know.
If I do the right thing am I given a pat on the back? Who cares if Kings are honourable or not?

[HonourGoodEduc]
<player> is a <man> you can rely on. The sooner <he> takes over from King <newKing>, the better.
Yes, <player> is a <man> of honour. I fully support <his> claim on the throne. We need a <man> like <him>.

[HonourGoodUned]
Can I rely on that Usurper, <player> to make my life better? I hear that you can trust <him>.
<player> is a man of honour. Sure <he> is. Old <randomFemale> swears on it and she's always right.
If <player> is going to be our King then <he> had better keep <his> honourable reputation. I can't stand fakers.
That <player> <man>. They say that <he> is honourable but what in <curse> do I know?

[HonourBadEduc]
King <newKing>'s word can be relied upon. I trust him.
When you talk about honour you can't go past King <newKing>. <He> does what <he> says and keeps <his> word. A good <man>.

[HonourBadUned]
Why would I want to trust <player>, the pretend King? Nobody else does.
<player> is about as honourable as a snake in the grass. At least you can rely on King <newKing> to do as he says.
<randomFemale> and I both think that <player> should crawl back to where <he> came from. <He> isn't King material.
<He>, that <player> person, is nothing but a greasy pig knee deep in a moorish bog. Honourable? Huh!

[KnownEduc]
They say that the Usurper, <player>, was seen in <locRecent> recently. What is <he> up to?
<player>? Yes, of course. Wasn't <he> in <locRecent> recently? It was this moon, I'm sure.
Word has it that <player> was seen entering the court of House <court>.
Was that <player> who was noticed leaving the court of House <court>?

[KnownUned]
The Usurper, <player>. Isn't he at <locRecent>?
I heard that <player> had visited <locRandom> once. Maybe <he> liked the ale?
<randomMale> from the village swore that he'd seen <player> at <locRandom>.
The word is that <player> was seen at <locRecent> but who am I to say?
<player> is here to save us all. Of course <he> is. Don't argue with me, I'm tired.

[UnknownEduc]
Who knows where <player> is? I heard the Inquisitors were asking after <him>.
<player> might have been seen in <locRandom> this moon, but I can't say for certain.
They say that <player> visited the court of House <court> but I can't say for sure.
The court of House <court>? Was <player> there recently? Who can tell?

[UnknownUned]
Do I care where <player> is? Does <he> know who I am and what my problems are? If you see <him> make sure you tell <him>.
I overheard <randomFemale> talking about <player> the other day. She sure knows how to curse.
Does it matter where <player> is? Does <he> care where I am?
I don't know where <player> is. Nobody tells me nothin.
What in <curse> do you mean, where is <player>? I've never heard of <him>, let alone seen <him>.
