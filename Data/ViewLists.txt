# Taxes

[TaxOfficialHigh]
It's a good thing that King <newKing> is doing with his high road tax. If it was up to me I'd tax it even more.
The Kingdom needs all the tax revenue it can collect. Tax 'em until they drop is my motto.
If King <newKing> keeps taxing the King's Road like he is I might be in for a pay rise.
The Road Tax is high but there is more juice that can be squeezed out of the lemon if King <newKing> is man enough.

[TaxOfficialLow]
The King's Road should be taxed at a higher rate than it is. Taxes pay for our wages.
The more taxes that King <newKing> collects the more likely it is that we are paid. I'm all for more taxes.
If the tax on the King's Road isn't raised soon then how will King <newKing> pay for the likes of us?
It is wrong of King <newKing> to undertax the King's Road. Without a high tax how can he afford people such as me?

[TaxChurchHigh]
King <newKing> wants to be careful that he doesn't upset the Gods by excessively taxing their churches here at <locName>.
If King <newKing> doesn't remove the ridiculously high tax on our Church then he will have to face the wrath of the Gods.
Judgement day is fast approaching for King <newKing> unless he does something about the excessive tax on our church.
The Gods do not view kindly Kings who try to tax their churches into extinction. King <newKing> wants to be careful.

[TaxChurchLow]
The Church at <locName> should not be obliged to pay tax to King <newKing> or any other King.
The Gods have clearly stated that the Church is not under any obligation to pay taxes.
Something is wrong when our lowly church, here at <locName>, is compelled to pay taxes to King <newKing>.
Churches and taxes don't mix. The Gods have said so. King <newKing> needs to listen to the Gods more often.

[TaxMerchantHigh]
Ursury is what it is. Taxes this high? Why am I still here in <locName> and not on a ship to somewhere else?
What future is there for the Kingdom if we are to be taxed at such a ruinouos rate?
It's criminal the amount of tax that King <newKing> is levying on us here at <locName>.
King <newKing> and his ridiculous taxes are what is going to be the end of us all.

[TaxMerchantLow]
Trade is an uncertain business at the best of times here at <locName>. Taxes, any taxes, dnn't help.
The sooner King <newKing> comes to his senses and gets rid of the taxes, the better.
I could enjoy living here at <locName> if it wasn't for the taxes. Damn King <newKing>.
Some say that the taxes are low but I'm not one of them. A tax is a tax and that's all there is to it.

[TaxCrafterHigh]
There's talk about stopping work if King <newKing> doesn't drop the tax. Even <randomFemale> is upset.
How can we be expected to make a living when taxes are so high?
What in <curse> does King <newKing> think we are, cows to be milked at will for more gold?
There is no future here in <locName>. King <newKing> has made sure of that with his ridiculous taxes.

[TaxCrafterLow]
It's hard enough trying to eke out a living here at <locName> without having to pay taxes.
Over the oceans they don't pay any tax. <randomMale> swears he heard it said at the Inn.
Can you begrudge King <newKing> from wanting the likes of me to pay some tax? Don't ask me, 'cause I'm drunk.
There's taxes and there's Kings. Funny isn't that the two always go together.

[TaxPeasantHigh]
If King <newKing> is going to tax Girls that much then there won't be any soon.
What in <curse> does King <newKing> think he is doing? Taxing Girls like they are made of Gold?
If King <newKing> wants to tax Girls that much then he can start feeding them.
<randomMale> says they are taxing Girls more than they taxing Lords. I'd like a word with King <newKing>.

[TaxPeasantLow]
You shouldn't have to pay no taxes on your daughters. It ain't fair.
Girls aren't supposed to be taxed. King <newKing> has got it all wrong.
Who said Girls have to be taxed? King <newKing> you say? Stuff him.
It's alright to tax pigs but not Girls. Everybody knows that.

[TaxNoneEduc]
It's all well can good to have to pay taxes but what's the point when it's all spent on Royal parties?
Taxes are for the little people. I don't pay any and nor should you.
If the Gods meant for us to pay taxes then we'd have been born with gold teeth.
If King <newKing> wants to tax other people then that's alright as long as he leaves me alone.

[TaxNoneUned]
I don't pay no tax to no King <newKing>. Why should I?
Who is stupid enough to pay taxes? King <newKing> can manage without my help, thankyou.
Is there a law that says you have to pay taxes to King <newKing>? Never heard of it.
<randomMale> says only fools and idiots pay taxes. Hasn't King <newKing> got enough gold already?

# Weather

[SummerEduc]
The gentle caress of a Summer breeze here in <locName> is one of life's greatest joys.
Summer is my favourite time here in <locName>.

[SummerUned]
It's hot, sweaty work for the likes of us in Summer. Who needs it?
Summer? Phhht! Work, work, work. Give me winter everytime.
There's nothin good about no Summer here in <locName>. A <man> could sweat to death on a hot day.
Summer in <locName> means the sickness. Just yesterday I saw <randomFemale> spewing her guts out on the street.

[AutumnEduc]
It's the squirrels frantically gathering their nuts that give me the most enjoyment during a <locName> Autumn.
The Ides of Autumn are upon us. Can you feel the heaviness in the air?

[AutumnUned]
Hard work for us in Autumn. Harvest time. Back breaking. Everybody has to help.
Autumn rains don't stop the harvest. Nothing does. Can't wait for winter.
Autumn is the worst time of the year. Harvest time. Work till you drop.
I'm thinking of leaving <locName>. Autumn chills and Autumn rains aren't good for my bones.
Lots of squirrels around here at <locName> 'cause it's Autumn. Squirrels taste nice. Roasted is best.

[WinterEduc]
The crisp, virgin white, snow is something to behold here in <locName>.
Winter has a sense of cleansing about it. <locName> looks cleaner covered in snow.

[WinterUned]
The Winter snow covers up the sh*t on the streets, have to give it that. <locName> looks better.
Trod in a pile of horse sh*t yesterday. Winter snow tricked me. Just my luck.
It's damn cold here in <locName>. Every Winter seems to be worse than the one before. 
If I could I've leave <locName> during Winter. To cold. To quiet. To much snow.

[SpringEduc]
The trees that cluster in pockets throughout <locName> are of many colors. Isn't Spring wonderful?
It is as if <locName> has been born anew. Spring and fertility are as one in my mind.

[SpringUned]
Spring. Planting season. My aching back. At least I'm not wading knee deep through dirty snow.
It'd be nice if somebody gave me some new clothes for Spring. The ones I have stink.
The best part about Spring is that you can go to the toilet anywhere, not just in that smelly hole in the corner.
Some people like Spring. I'm not one of them. If I had a pair of shoes I might feel better about it.

# Food

[FoodSurplusEduc]
The food here at <locName> is a delight. Have you tasted the <food>?
My table is never empty of food. There is an abundance. Especially of <food>.

[FoodSurplusUned]
There's always plenty of food here at <locName>. Nobody goes hungry.
One good thing about <locName> is the amount of available food. Pity that it's mostly <food>.
You probably haven't noticed but there are a lot of fat people around <locName>. It's because of the <food>.
You could eat yourself silly here in <locName>. More <food> here than you can poke a stick at.

[FoodDeficitEduc]
What I miss most is the specialty of <locName>, the <food>. Why do I have to go without?
It is a terrible impost to have to go without <food>. I admit to feeling hungry some days.

[FoodDeficitUned]
Why do I always feel hungry? That's what's wrong with <locName> - there's never enough food.
Yes there is <food> to eat here at <locName>. But there's not enough of it. People are hungry.
It's hard living in a place like <locName> where we don't have enough food. Tough on the children, it is.
Who was the idiot who decided to build <locName> in a place without enough food? Is <food> all there is?

[FoodNormalEduc]
The food situation here at <locName>? Is it a problem? I can't see anyone starving.
The <food> here at <locName> is exquisite.

[FoodNormalUned]
I'm getting sick of eating <food> every day. Isn't there something different?
What's the point of dinner if all you get to eat is <food>?
I love <food>. Just as well. I don't eat a lot else.
If you had told me that I would grow to like <food> I wouldn't have believed you.

# Game States

[JusticeNeutralEduc]
Does <player> have a right to be King? Hard to say.
Justice is a relative term. I'd consider that both <player> and King <newKing> have valid claims on the throne.

[JusticeNeutralUned]
Kings are all the same. Who cares if it's <player> or King <newKing>?
Justice, what in <curse> is that? Why should I care about <player> and <his> crown?
So <player> thinks that <he> has a just cause? What about mine? Who's helping me?
Justice, fustice. What in <curse> does it have to do with me? Does any King care about me?

[JusticeGoodEduc]
Yes, of course <player>, the Usurper, should be King. It's <his> birthright.
When your cause is just the wind blows from behind. <player> should set <his> sails.

[JusticeGoodUned]
So <player> thinks that they should be King? Doesn't everybody?
If <player> wants to be King then let <him> win the crown. Justice doesn't count for much around here.
<player> has a right to the throne, does <he>? Where's my right to a decent wage?
Yes, yes, <player> is the rightful King. What else in <curse> do you expect me to say?

[JusticeBadEduc]
King <newKing> sits rightfully upon the throne. <player> is nothing but an imposter.
<player>, the Imposter, should stop bothering King <newKing> as <his> cause is unjust and <his> health is a about to worsen.

[JusticeBadUned]
King <newKing> is the King and good on him. <player> is fit for nothing more than pig swill
<player> has as much claim to the crown as I do.
King <newKing> is in charge. He has a god given right to sit upon the throne, not some stranger.
What in <curse> does <player> think <he> is doing? <newKing> is our rightful ruler, not some has been stranger.

[LegendNeutralEduc]
I never did go much on Old King <oldKing> but I don't like the new King <newKing> either
Those who do become legends. Those who don't die. <player> needs to step up.

[LegendNeutralUned]
<player>? Who's he?
Everybody is a legend in their own mind. I bet <player> thinks <he> is a God. Pigs *ss.
A legend you say? Tell me what <player> has done other than fluff around?
I like legends who do things. <player> hasn't done nothin famous, <randomFemale> said so.
What in <curse> am I expected to do? Bow down and worship the great deeds of <player>? Pig's *rse.

[LegendGoodEduc]
Didn't the <player>, the Usurper, once kill a lion with <his> bare hands?
It's said that <player> is a geniune legend but nobody can state why?

[LegendGoodUned]
That heir, <player>, <he> will chew King <newKing>'s balls off before breakfast
They say that <he> sh*ts arrows and farts bolts. <player> sure is a legend around here.
Yeah, <player> is a legend. Ask <randomMale> 'cause he swears that he saw <him> kill a full grown <animalBig> with <his> bare hands.
I consider myself a true legend around here. Just like that <player> person. <He>'s one of us.
I'd like me some roast <animalBig>. Is <player> the <man> to get it for me?

[LegendBadEduc]
<player>, the so called Usurper, I heard the <he> was frightened to crawl out of <his> bed in the morning.
King <newKing> is a real legend. Singlehandedly ate an entire pig at a feast. <player>, you say? Who?

[LegendBadUned]
King <newKing> will piss all over <player>. Everybody knows that.
<player> a Legend? Hah! King <newKing> is a real live legend. He eats babies for breakfast, he does.
I don't know where you got the idea that <player> is a legend? Maybe a maggoty cow pat. <newKing> is the real legend.
King <newKing> is a giant among men. That <player>? Walking worm food.

[HonourNeutralEduc]
Who can you trust more? King <newKing> or the Usurper, <player>
Honour is an important part of a <man>. It's difficult to judge <player> as I don't know <him>.

[HonourNeutralUned]
Kings and Usurpers treat you like dirt. The pox on all of them.
What does it matter if <player> is honourable, or not? Will it put food my my table?
When did honour have anything to do with anything? <player> could be a pig in disguise, for all I know.
If I do the right thing am I given a pat on the back? Who cares if Kings are honourable or not?

[HonourGoodEduc]
<player> is a <man> you can rely on. The sooner <he> takes over from King <newKing>, the better.
Yes, <player> is a <man> of honour. I fully support <his> claim on the throne. We need a <man> like <him>.

[HonourGoodUned]
Can I rely on that Usurper, <player>, to make my life better? I hear that you can trust <him>.
<player> is a man of honour. Sure <he> is. Old <randomFemale> swears on it and she's always right.
If <player> is going to be our King then <he> had better keep <his> honourable reputation. I can't stand fakers.
That <player> <man>. They say that <he> is honourable but what in <curse> do I know?

[HonourBadEduc]
King <newKing>'s word can be relied upon. I trust him.
When you talk about honour you can't go past King <newKing>. <He> does what <he> says and keeps <his> word. A good <man>.

[HonourBadUned]
Why would I want to trust <player>, the pretend King? Nobody else does.
<player> is about as honourable as a snake in the grass. At least you can rely on King <newKing> to do as he says.
<randomFemale> and I both think that <player> should crawl back to where <he> came from. <He> isn't King material.
<He>, that <player> person, is nothing but a greasy pig knee deep in a moorish bog. Honourable? Huh!

# Known

[KnownEduc]

I overheard <randomFemale> talking about <player> the other day. She sure knows how to curse.
Does it matter where <player> is? Does <he> care where I am?
