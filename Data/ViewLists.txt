[SummerEduc]
The gentle caress of a Summer breeze here in <locName> is one of life's greatest joys.
Summer is my favourite time here in <locName>.

[SummerUned]
It's hot, sweaty work for the likes of us in Summer. Who needs it?
Summer? Phhht! Work, work, work. Give me winter everytime.
There's nothin good about no Summer here in <locName>. A <man> could sweat to death on a hot day.
Summer in <locName> means the sickness. Just yesterday I saw <randomFemale> spewing her guts out on the street.

[AutumnEduc]
It's the squirrels frantically gathering their nuts that give me the most enjoyment during a <locName> Autumn.
The Ides of Autumn are upon us. Can you feel the heaviness in the air?

[AutumnUned]
Hard work for us in Autumn. Harvest time. Back breaking. Everybody has to help.
Autumn rains don't stop the harvest. Nothing does. Can't wait for winter.
Autumn is the worst time of the year. Harvest time. Work till you drop.
I'm thinking of leaving <locName>. Autumn chills and Autumn rains aren't good for my bones.
Lots of squirrels around here at <locName> 'cause it's Autumn. Squirrels taste nice. Roasted is best.

[WinterEduc]
The crisp, virgin white, snow is something to behold here in <locName>.
Winter has a sense of cleansing about it. <locName> looks cleaner covered in snow.

[WinterUned]
The Winter snow covers up the sh*t on the streets, have to give it that. <locName> looks better.
Trod in a pile of horse sh*t yesterday. Winter snow tricked me. Just my luck.
It's damn cold here in <locName>. Every Winter seems to be worse than the one before. 
If I could I've leave <locName> during Winter. To cold. To quiet. To much snow.

[SpringEduc]
The trees that cluster in pockets throughout <locName> are of many colors. Isn't Spring wonderful?
It is as if <locName> has been born anew. Spring and fertility are as one in my mind.

[SpringUned]
Spring. Planting season. My aching back. At least I'm not wading knee deep through dirty snow.
It'd be nice if somebody gave me some new clothes for Spring. The ones I have stink.
The best part about Spring is that you can go to the toilet anywhere, not just in that smelly hole in the corner.
Some people like Spring. I'm not one of them. If I had a pair of shoes I might feel better about it.

[FoodSurplusEduc]
The food here at <locName> is a delight. Have you tasted the <food>?
My table is never empty of food. There is an abundance. Especially of <food>.

[FoodSurplusUned]
There's always plenty of food here at <locName>. Nobody goes hungry.
One good thing about <locName> is the amount of available food. Pity that it's mostly <food>.
You probably haven't noticed but there are a lot of fat people around <locName>. It's because of the <food>.
You could eat yourself silly here in <locName>. More <food> here than you can poke a stick at.

[FoodDeficitEduc]
What I miss most is the specialty of <locName>, the <food>. Why do I have to go without?
It is a terrible impost to have to go without <food>. I admit to feeling hungry some days.

[FoodDeficitUned]
Why do I always feel hungry? That's what's wrong with <locName> - there's never enough food.
Yes there is <food> to eat here at <locName>. But there's not enough of it. People are hungry.
It's hard living in a place like <locName> where we don't have enough food. Tough on the children, it is.
Who was the idiot who decided to build <locName> in a place without enough food? Is <food> all there is?

[FoodNormalEduc]
The food situation here at <locName>? Is it a problem? I can't see anyone starving.
The <food> here at <locName> is exquisite.

[FoodNormalUned]
I'm getting sick of eating <food> every day. Isn't there something different?
What's the point of dinner if all you get to eat is <food>?
I love <food>. Just as well. I don't eat a lot else.
If you had told me that I would grow to like <food> I wouldn't have believed you.

[JusticeNeutralEduc]
Does <player> have a right to be King? Hard to say.
Justice is a relative term. I'd consider that both <player> and King <newKing> have valid claims on the throne.

[JusticeNeutralUned]
Kings are all the same. Who cares if it's <player> or King <newKing>?
Justice, what in <curse> is that? Why should I care about <player> and <his> crown?
So <player> thinks that <he> has a just cause? What about mine? Who's helping me?
Justice, fustice. What in <curse> does it have to do with me? Does any King care about me?

[JusticeGoodEduc]
Yes, of course <player>, the Usurper, should be King. It's <his> birthright.
When your cause is just the wind blows from behind. <player> should set <his> sails.

[JusticeGoodUned]
So <player> thinks that they should be King? Doesn't everybody?
If <player> wants to be King then let <him> win the crown. Justice doesn't count for much around here.
<player> has a right to the throne, does <he>? Where's my right to a decent wage?
Yes, yes, <player> is the rightful King. What in <curse> do you expect me to say?

[JusticeBadEduc]
King <newKing> sits rightfully upon the throne. <player> is nothing but an imposter.
<player>, the Imposter, should stop bothering King <newKing> as <his> cause is unjust and <his> health is a about to worsen.

[JusticeBadUned]
King <newKing> is the King and good on him. <player> is fit for nothing more than pig swill
<player> has as much claim to the crown as I do.
King <newKing> is in charge. He has a god given right to sit upon the throne, not some stranger.
What in <curse> does <player> think <he> is doing? <newKing> is our rightful ruler, not some has been stranger.

[LegendNeutralEduc]
I never did go much on Old King <oldKing> but I don't like the new King <newKing> either
Those who do become legends. Those who don't die. <player> needs to step up.

[LegendNeutralUned]
<player>? Who's he?
Everybody is a legend in their own mind. I bet <player> thinks <he> is a God. Pigs *ss.
A legend you say? Tell me what <player> has done other than fluff around?
I like legends who do things. <player> hasn't done nothin famous, <randomFemale> said so.
What in <curse> am I expected to do? Bow down and worship the great deeds of <player>? Pig's *rse.

[LegendGoodEduc]
Didn't the <player>, the Usurper, once kill a lion with <his> bare hands?
It's said that <player> is a geniune legend but nobody can state why?

[LegendGoodUned]
That heir, <player>, <he> will chew King <newKing>'s balls off before breakfast
They say that <he> sh*ts arrows and farts bolts. <player> sure is a legend around here.
Yeah, <player> is a legend. Ask <randomMale> 'cause he swears that he saw <him> kill a full grown <animalBig> with <his> bare hands.
I consider myself a true legend around here. Just like that <player> person. <He>'s one of us.

[LegendBadEduc]
<player>, the so called Usurper, I heard the <he> was frightened to crawk out of <his> bed in the morning.
King <newKing> is a real legend. Singlehandedly ate an entire pig at a feast. <player>, you say? Who?

[LegendBadUned]
King <newKing> will piss all over <player>. Everybody knows that.
<player> a Legend? Hah! King <newKing> is a real live legend. He eats babies for breakfast, he does.
I don't know where you got the idea that <player> is a legend? Maybe a maggoty cow pat. <newKing> is the real legend.
King <newKing> is a giant among men. That <player>? Walking worm food.

[HonourNeutralEduc]
Who can you trust more? King <newKing> or the Usurper, <player>
Honour is an important part of a <man>. It's difficult to judge <player> as I don't know <him>.

[HonourNeutralUned]
Kings and Usurpers treat you like dirt. The pox on all of them.
What does it matter if <player> is honourable, or not? Will it put food my my table?
When did honour have anything to do with anything? <player> could be a pig in disguise, for all I know.
If I do the right thing am I given a pat on the back? Who cares if Kings are honourable or not?

[HonourGoodEduc]
<player> is a <man> you can rely on. The sooner <he> takes over from King <newKing>, the better.
Yes, <player> is a <man> of honour. I fully support <his> claim on the throne. We need a <man> like <him>.

[HonourGoodUned]
Can I rely on that Usurper, <player> to make my life better? I hear that you can trust <him>.
<player> is a man of honour. Sure <he> is. Old <randomFemale> swears on it and she's always right.
If <player> is going to be our King then <he> had better keep <his> honourable reputation. I can't stand fakers.
That <player> <man>. They say that <he> is honourable but what in <curse> do I know?

[HonourBadEduc]
King <newKing>'s word can be relied upon. I trust him.
When you talk about honour you can't go past King <newKing>. <He> does what <he> says and keeps <his> word. A good <man>.

[HonourBadUned]
Why would I want to trust <player>, the pretend King? Nobody else does.
<player> is about as honourable as a snake in the grass. At least you can rely on King <newKing> to do as he says.
<randomFemale> and I both think that <player> should crawl back to where <he> came from. <He> isn't King material.
<He>, that <player> person, is nothing but a greasy pig knee deep in a moorish bog. Honourable? Huh!

[KnownEduc]
They say that the Usurper, <player>, was seen in <locRecent> recently. What is <he> up to?
<player>? Yes, of course. Wasn't <he> in <locRecent> recently? It was this moon, I'm sure.
Word has it that <player> was seen entering the court of House <court>.
Was that <player> who was noticed leaving the court of House <court>?

[KnownUned]
The Usurper, <player>. Isn't he at <locRecent>?
I heard that <player> had visited <locRandom> once. Maybe <he> liked the ale?
<randomMale> from the village swore that he'd seen <player> at <locRandom>.
The word is that <player> was seen at <locRecent> but who am I to say?
<player> is here to save us all. Of course <he> is. Don't argue with me, I'm tired.

[UnknownEduc]
Who knows where <player> is? I heard the Inquisitors were asking after <him>.
<player> might have been seen in <locRandom> this moon, but I can't say for certain.
They say that <player> visited the court of House <court> but I can't say for sure.
The court of House <court>? Was <player> there recently? Who can tell?

[UnknownUned]
Do I care where <player> is? Does <he> know who I am and what my problems are? If you see <him> make sure you tell <him>.
I overheard <randomFemale> talking about <player> the other day. She sure knows how to curse.
Does it matter where <player> is? Does <he> care where I am?
I don't know where <player> is. Nobody tells me nothin.
What in <curse> do you mean, where is <player>? I've never heard of <him>, let alone seen <him>.
